Abstract: Accurately localizing 3D objects like pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles is essential in Autonomous Driving. To ensure high detection performance, Autonomous Vehicles complement RGB cameras with LiDAR sensors, but effectively combining these data sources for 3D object detection remains challenging. We propose LCF3D, a novel sensor fusion framework that combines a 2D object detector on RGB images with a 3D object detector on LiDAR point clouds. By leveraging multimodal fusion principles, we compensate for inaccuracies in the LiDAR object detection network. Our solution combines two key principles: (i) late fusion, to reduce LiDAR False Positives by matching LiDAR 3D detections with RGB 2D detections and filtering out unmatched LiDAR detections; and (ii) cascade fusion, to recover missed objects from LiDAR by generating new 3D frustum proposals corresponding to unmatched RGB detections. Experiments show that LCF3D is beneficial for domain generalization, as it turns out to be successful in handling different sensor configurations between training and testing domains. LCF3D achieves significant improvements over LiDAR-based methods, particularly for challenging categories like pedestrians and cyclists in the KITTI dataset, as well as motorcycles and bicycles in nuScenes.

Abstract: Background: Pneumonia remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children worldwide, emphasizing the need for accurate and efficient diagnostic support tools. Deep learning has shown strong potential in medical image analysis, particularly for chest X-ray interpretation. This study compares two state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for automated pediatric pneumonia detection. Methods: A publicly available dataset of 5,863 pediatric chest X-ray images was used. Images were preprocessed through normalization, resizing, and data augmentation to enhance generalization. DenseNet121 and EfficientNet-B0 were fine-tuned using pretrained ImageNet weights under identical training settings. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and recall. Model explainability was incorporated using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to visualize image regions influencing predictions. Results: EfficientNet-B0 outperformed DenseNet121, achieving an accuracy of 84.6%, F1-score of 0.8899, and MCC of 0.6849. DenseNet121 achieved 79.7% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.8597, and MCC of 0.5852. Both models demonstrated high recall values above 0.99, indicating strong sensitivity to pneumonia detection. Grad-CAM and LIME visualizations showed consistent focus on clinically relevant lung regions, supporting the reliability of model decisions. Conclusions: EfficientNet-B0 provided a more balanced and computationally efficient performance compared to DenseNet121, making it a strong candidate for clinical deployment. The integration of explainability techniques enhances transparency and trustworthiness in AI-assisted pediatric pneumonia diagnosis.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 offer strong generative priors that are highly valuable for image restoration, yet their full pipelines remain too computationally heavy for deployment on edge devices. Existing lightweight variants predominantly compress the denoising U-Net or reduce the diffusion trajectory, which disrupts the underlying latent manifold and limits generalization beyond a single task. We introduce NanoSD, a family of Pareto-optimal diffusion foundation models distilled from Stable Diffusion 1.5 through network surgery, feature-wise generative distillation, and structured architectural scaling jointly applied to the U-Net and the VAE encoder-decoder. This full-pipeline co-design preserves the generative prior while producing models that occupy distinct operating points along the accuracy-latency-size frontier (e.g., 130M-315M parameters, achieving real-time inference down to 20ms on mobile-class NPUs). We show that parameter reduction alone does not correlate with hardware efficiency, and we provide an analysis revealing how architectural balance, feature routing, and latent-space preservation jointly shape true on-device latency. When used as a drop-in backbone, NanoSD enables state-of-the-art performance across image super-resolution, image deblurring, face restoration, and monocular depth estimation, outperforming prior lightweight diffusion models in both perceptual quality and practical deployability. NanoSD establishes a general-purpose diffusion foundation model family suitable for real-time visual generation and restoration on edge devices.

Abstract: Multimodal video captioning condenses dense footage into a structured format of keyframes and natural language. By creating a cohesive multimodal summary, this approach anchors generative AI in rich semantic evidence and serves as a lightweight proxy for high-efficiency retrieval. However, traditional metrics like BLEU or ROUGE fail to quantify information coverage across disparate modalities, such as comparing a paragraph of text to a sequence of keyframes. To address this, we propose the Video Summary Information Loss (ViSIL) score, an information-theoretic framework that quantifies the video information not captured by a summary via vision-language model (VLM) inference. By measuring the information loss, ViSIL is a unified metric that enables direct comparison across multimodal summary formats despite their structural discrepancies. Our results demonstrate that ViSIL scores show a statistically significant correlation with both human and VLM performance on Video Question Answering (VQA) tasks. ViSIL also enables summary selection to optimize the trade-off between information loss and processing speed, establishing a Pareto-optimal frontier that outperforms text summaries by $7\%$ in VQA accuracy without increasing processing load.

Abstract: CLIP has become a cornerstone of multimodal representation learning, yet improving its performance typically requires a prohibitively costly process of training from scratch on billions of samples. We ask a different question: Can we improve the performance of open-weight CLIP models across various downstream tasks using only existing self-supervised datasets? Unlike supervised fine-tuning, which adapts a pretrained model to a single downstream task, our setting seeks to improve general performance across various tasks. However, as both our experiments and prior studies reveal, simply applying standard training protocols starting from an open-weight CLIP model often fails, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce TuneCLIP, a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that overcomes the performance degradation. TuneCLIP has two key components: (1) a warm-up stage of recovering optimization statistics to reduce cold-start bias, inspired by theoretical analysis, and (2) a fine-tuning stage of optimizing a new contrastive loss to mitigate the penalization on false negative pairs. Our extensive experiments show that TuneCLIP consistently improves performance across model architectures and scales. Notably, it elevates leading open-weight models like SigLIP (ViT-B/16), achieving gains of up to +2.5% on ImageNet and related out-of-distribution benchmarks, and +1.2% on the highly competitive DataComp benchmark, setting a new strong baseline for efficient post-pretraining adaptation.

Abstract: We present VibrantSR (Vibrant Super-Resolution), a generative super-resolution framework for estimating 0.5 meter canopy height models (CHMs) from 10 meter Sentinel-2 imagery. Unlike approaches based on aerial imagery that are constrained by infrequent and irregular acquisition schedules, VibrantSR leverages globally available Sentinel-2 seasonal composites, enabling consistent monitoring at a seasonal-to-annual cadence. Evaluated across 22 EPA Level 3 eco-regions in the western United States using spatially disjoint validation splits, VibrantSR achieves a Mean Absolute Error of 4.39 meters for canopy heights >= 2 m, outperforming Meta (4.83 m), LANDFIRE (5.96 m), and ETH (7.05 m) satellite-based benchmarks. While aerial-based VibrantVS (2.71 m MAE) retains an accuracy advantage, VibrantSR enables operational forest monitoring and carbon accounting at continental scales without reliance on costly and temporally infrequent aerial acquisitions.

Abstract: Recent progress in medical vision-language models (VLMs) has achieved strong performance on image-level text-centric tasks such as report generation and visual question answering (VQA). However, achieving fine-grained visual grounding and volumetric spatial reasoning in 3D medical VLMs remains challenging, particularly when aiming to unify these capabilities within a single, generalizable framework. To address this challenge, we proposed MedVL-SAM2, a unified 3D medical multimodal model that concurrently supports report generation, VQA, and multi-paradigm segmentation, including semantic, referring, and interactive segmentation. MedVL-SAM2 integrates image-level reasoning and pixel-level perception through a cohesive architecture tailored for 3D medical imaging, and incorporates a SAM2-based volumetric segmentation module to enable precise multi-granular spatial reasoning. The model is trained in a multi-stage pipeline: it is first pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of 3D CT image-text pairs to align volumetric visual features with radiology-language embeddings. It is then jointly optimized with both language-understanding and segmentation objectives using a comprehensive 3D CT segmentation dataset. This joint training enables flexible interaction via language, point, or box prompts, thereby unifying high-level visual reasoning with spatially precise localization. Our unified architecture delivers state-of-the-art performance across report generation, VQA, and multiple 3D segmentation tasks. Extensive analyses further show that the model provides reliable 3D visual grounding, controllable interactive segmentation, and robust cross-modal reasoning, demonstrating that high-level semantic reasoning and precise 3D localization can be jointly achieved within a unified 3D medical VLM.

Abstract: Reliable traversable area segmentation in unstructured environments is critical for planning and decision-making in autonomous driving. However, existing data-driven approaches often suffer from degraded segmentation performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, consequently impairing downstream driving tasks. To address this issue, we propose OT-Drive, an Optimal Transport--driven multi-modal fusion framework. The proposed method formulates RGB and surface normal fusion as a distribution transport problem. Specifically, we design a novel Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) to decompose scene information into the joint distribution of weather, time-of-day, and road type, thereby constructing semantic anchors that can generalize to unseen scenarios. Subsequently, we design an innovative Optimal Transport-based multi-modal fusion module (OT Fusion) to transport RGB and surface normal features onto the manifold defined by the semantic anchors, enabling robust traversable area segmentation under OOD scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 95.16% mIoU on ORFD OOD scenarios, outperforming prior methods by 6.35%, and 89.79% mIoU on cross-dataset transfer tasks, surpassing baselines by 13.99%.These results indicate that the proposed model can attain strong OOD generalization with only limited training data, substantially enhancing its practicality and efficiency for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, but their ability to capture spatial relationships remains a blindspot. Current VLMs are typically built with contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) style image encoders. The training recipe often flattens images into 1D patch sequences, discarding the 2D structure necessary for spatial reasoning. We argue that this lack of spatial awareness is a missing dimension in VLM design and a bottleneck for applications requiring spatial grounding, such as robotics and embodied AI. To address this, we investigate (i) image encoders trained with alternative objectives and (ii) 2D positional encodings. Our experiments show that these architectural choices can lead to improved spatial reasoning on several benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reasoning segmentation is an emerging vision-language task that requires reasoning over intricate text queries to precisely segment objects. However, existing methods typically suffer from overthinking, generating verbose reasoning chains that interfere with object localization in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this issue, we propose DR$^2$Seg, a self-rewarding framework that improves both reasoning efficiency and segmentation accuracy without requiring extra thinking supervision. DR$^2$Seg employs a two-stage rollout strategy that decomposes reasoning segmentation into multimodal reasoning and referring segmentation. In the first stage, the model generates a self-contained description that explicitly specifies the target object. In the second stage, this description replaces the original complex query to verify its self-containment. Based on this design, two self-rewards are introduced to strengthen goal-oriented reasoning and suppress redundant thinking. Extensive experiments across MLLMs of varying scales and segmentation models demonstrate that DR$^2$Seg consistently improves reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the two most prevalent and incurable neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) worldwide, for which early diagnosis is critical to delay their progression. However, the high dimensionality of multi-metric data with diverse structural forms, the heterogeneity of neuroimaging and phenotypic data, and class imbalance collectively pose significant challenges to early ND diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamically weighted dual graph attention network (DW-DGAT) that integrates: (1) a general-purpose data fusion strategy to merge three structural forms of multi-metric data; (2) a dual graph attention architecture based on brain regions and inter-sample relationships to extract both micro- and macro-level features; and (3) a class weight generation mechanism combined with two stable and effective loss functions to mitigate class imbalance. Rigorous experiments, based on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) and Alzhermer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) studies, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) exhibit various types of hallucinations. Existing research has primarily focused on hallucinations involving the presence of events, objects, and scenes in videos, while largely neglecting event relation hallucination. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating the Video Event Relation Hallucination, named VERHallu. This benchmark focuses on causal, temporal, and subevent relations between events, encompassing three types of tasks: relation classification, question answering, and counterfactual question answering, for a comprehensive evaluation of event relation hallucination. Additionally, it features counterintuitive video scenarios that deviate from typical pretraining distributions, with each sample accompanied by human-annotated candidates covering both vision-language and pure language biases. Our analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art VideoLLMs struggle with dense-event relation reasoning, often relying on prior knowledge due to insufficient use of frame-level cues. Although these models demonstrate strong grounding capabilities for key events, they often overlook the surrounding subevents, leading to an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of event relations. To tackle this, we propose a Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy, which reallocates frame-level attention within intermediate layers to enhance multi-event understanding. Experiments show it effectively mitigates the event relation hallucination without affecting inference speed.

Abstract: Text-to-image person re-identification (TIReID) aims to retrieve person images from a large gallery given free-form textual descriptions. TIReID is challenging due to the substantial modality gap between visual appearances and textual expressions, as well as the need to model fine-grained correspondences that distinguish individuals with similar attributes such as clothing color, texture, or outfit style. To address these issues, we propose DiCo (Disentangled Concept Representation), a novel framework that achieves hierarchical and disentangled cross-modal alignment. DiCo introduces a shared slot-based representation, where each slot acts as a part-level anchor across modalities and is further decomposed into multiple concept blocks. This design enables the disentanglement of complementary attributes (\textit{e.g.}, color, texture, shape) while maintaining consistent part-level correspondence between image and text. Extensive experiments on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods, while also enhancing interpretability through explicit slot- and block-level representations for more fine-grained retrieval results.

Abstract: Underwater imaging is fundamentally challenging due to wavelength-dependent light attenuation, strong scattering from suspended particles, turbidity-induced blur, and non-uniform illumination. These effects impair standard cameras and make ground-truth motion nearly impossible to obtain. On the other hand, event cameras offer microsecond resolution and high dynamic range. Nonetheless, progress on investigating event cameras for underwater environments has been limited due to the lack of datasets that pair realistic underwater optics with accurate optical flow. To address this problem, we introduce the first synthetic underwater benchmark dataset for event-based optical flow derived from physically-based ray-traced RGBD sequences. Using a modern video-to-event pipeline applied to rendered underwater videos, we produce realistic event data streams with dense ground-truth flow, depth, and camera motion. Moreover, we benchmark state-of-the-art learning-based and model-based optical flow prediction methods to understand how underwater light transport affects event formation and motion estimation accuracy. Our dataset establishes a new baseline for future development and evaluation of underwater event-based perception algorithms. The source code and dataset for this project are publicly available at https://robotic-vision-lab.github.io/ueof.

Abstract: Recent video generation models have revealed the emergence of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning, enabling frame-by-frame visual inference. With this capability, video models have been successfully applied to various visual tasks (e.g., maze solving, visual puzzles). However, their potential to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation remains largely unexplored due to the absence of a clearly defined visual reasoning starting point and interpretable intermediate states in the T2I generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose CoF-T2I, a model that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I generation via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps and the final frame is taken as output. To establish such an explicit generation process, we curate CoF-Evol-Instruct, a dataset of CoF trajectories that model the generation process from semantics to aesthetics. To further improve quality and avoid motion artifacts, we enable independent encoding operation for each frame. Experiments show that CoF-T2I significantly outperforms the base video model and achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks, reaching 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench. These results indicate the substantial promise of video models for advancing high-quality text-to-image generation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce ReaMIL (Reasoning- and Evidence-Aware MIL), a multiple instance learning approach for whole-slide histopathology that adds a light selection head to a strong MIL backbone. The head produces soft per-tile gates and is trained with a budgeted-sufficiency objective: a hinge loss that enforces the true-class probability to be $\geq τ$ using only the kept evidence, under a sparsity budget on the number of selected tiles. The budgeted-sufficiency objective yields small, spatially compact evidence sets without sacrificing baseline performance. Across TCGA-NSCLC (LUAD vs. LUSC), TCGA-BRCA (IDC vs. Others), and PANDA, ReaMIL matches or slightly improves baseline AUC and provides quantitative evidence-efficiency diagnostics. On NSCLC, it attains AUC 0.983 with a mean minimal sufficient K (MSK) $\approx 8.2$ tiles at $τ= 0.90$ and AUKC $\approx 0.864$, showing that class confidence rises sharply and stabilizes once a small set of tiles is kept. The method requires no extra supervision, integrates seamlessly with standard MIL training, and naturally yields slide-level overlays. We report accuracy alongside MSK, AUKC, and contiguity for rigorous evaluation of model behavior on WSIs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In 1888, Vincent van Gogh wrote, "I am seeking exaggeration in the essential." This principle, amplifying structural form while suppressing photographic detail, lies at the core of Post-Impressionist art. However, most existing 3D style transfer methods invert this philosophy, treating geometry as a rigid substrate for surface-level texture projection. To authentically reproduce Post-Impressionist stylization, geometric abstraction must be embraced as the primary vehicle of expression.
  We propose a flow-guided geometric advection framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operationalizes this principle in a mesh-free setting. Our method extracts directional flow fields from 2D paintings and back-propagates them into 3D space, rectifying Gaussian primitives to form flow-aligned brushstrokes that conform to scene topology without relying on explicit mesh priors. This enables expressive structural deformation driven directly by painterly motion rather than photometric constraints.
  Our contributions are threefold: (1) a projection-based, mesh-free flow guidance mechanism that transfers 2D artistic motion into 3D Gaussian geometry; (2) a luminance-structure decoupling strategy that isolates geometric deformation from color optimization, mitigating artifacts during aggressive structural abstraction; and (3) a VLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework that assesses artistic authenticity through aesthetic judgment instead of conventional pixel-level metrics, explicitly addressing the subjective nature of artistic stylization.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose difficulty-guided sampling (DGS) to bridge the target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task, therefore improving the performance of dataset distillation. Deep neural networks achieve remarkable performance but have time and storage-consuming training processes. Dataset distillation is proposed to generate compact, high-quality distilled datasets, enabling effective model training while maintaining downstream performance. Existing approaches typically focus on features extracted from the original dataset, overlooking task-specific information, which leads to a target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task. We propose leveraging characteristics that benefit the downstream training into data distillation to bridge this gap. Focusing on the downstream task of image classification, we introduce the concept of difficulty and propose DGS as a plug-in post-stage sampling module. Following the specific target difficulty distribution, the final distilled dataset is sampled from image pools generated by existing methods. We also propose difficulty-aware guidance (DAG) to explore the effect of difficulty in the generation process. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. It also highlights the broader potential of difficulty for diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal learning have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, state-of-the-art approaches rely heavily on large-scale human-annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we introduce V-Zero, a general post-training framework that facilitates self-improvement using exclusively unlabeled images. V-Zero establishes a co-evolutionary loop by instantiating two distinct roles: a Questioner and a Solver. The Questioner learns to synthesize high-quality, challenging questions by leveraging a dual-track reasoning reward that contrasts intuitive guesses with reasoned results. The Solver is optimized using pseudo-labels derived from majority voting over its own sampled responses. Both roles are trained iteratively via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), driving a cycle of mutual enhancement. Remarkably, without a single human annotation, V-Zero achieves consistent performance gains on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, improving visual mathematical reasoning by +1.7 and general vision-centric by +2.6, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement in multimodal systems.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify instances from both known and novel categories within a large-scale unlabeled dataset, a critical yet challenging task for real-world, open-world applications. However, existing methods often rely on pseudo-labeling, or two-stage clustering, which lack a principled mechanism to explicitly disentangle essential, category-defining signals from instance-specific noise. In this paper, we address this fundamental limitation by re-framing GCD from an information-theoretic perspective, grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. We introduce InfoSculpt, a novel framework that systematically sculpts the representation space by minimizing a dual Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) objective. InfoSculpt uniquely combines a Category-Level CMI on labeled data to learn compact and discriminative representations for known classes, and a complementary Instance-Level CMI on all data to distill invariant features by compressing augmentation-induced noise. These two objectives work synergistically at different scales to produce a disentangled and robust latent space where categorical information is preserved while noisy, instance-specific details are discarded. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that InfoSculpt validating the effectiveness of our information-theoretic approach.

Abstract: Interactive humanoid video generation aims to synthesize lifelike visual agents that can engage with humans through continuous and responsive video. Despite recent advances in video synthesis, existing methods often grapple with the trade-off between high-fidelity synthesis and real-time interaction requirements. In this paper, we propose FlowAct-R1, a framework specifically designed for real-time interactive humanoid video generation. Built upon a MMDiT architecture, FlowAct-R1 enables the streaming synthesis of video with arbitrary durations while maintaining low-latency responsiveness. We introduce a chunkwise diffusion forcing strategy, complemented by a novel self-forcing variant, to alleviate error accumulation and ensure long-term temporal consistency during continuous interaction. By leveraging efficient distillation and system-level optimizations, our framework achieves a stable 25fps at 480p resolution with a time-to-first-frame (TTFF) of only around 1.5 seconds. The proposed method provides holistic and fine-grained full-body control, enabling the agent to transition naturally between diverse behavioral states in interactive scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowAct-R1 achieves exceptional behavioral vividness and perceptual realism, while maintaining robust generalization across diverse character styles.

Abstract: The automated extraction of structured questions from paper-based mathematics exams is fundamental to intelligent education, yet remains challenging in real-world settings due to severe visual noise. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on clean documents or generic layout analysis, overlooking both the structural integrity of mathematical problems and the ability of models to actively reject incomplete inputs. We introduce MathDoc, the first benchmark for document-level information extraction from authentic high school mathematics exam papers. MathDoc contains \textbf{3,609} carefully curated questions with real-world artifacts and explicitly includes unrecognizable samples to evaluate active refusal behavior. We propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework covering stem accuracy, visual similarity, and refusal capability. Experiments on SOTA MLLMs, including Qwen3-VL and Gemini-2.5-Pro, show that although end-to-end models achieve strong extraction performance, they consistently fail to refuse illegible inputs, instead producing confident but invalid outputs. These results highlight a critical gap in current MLLMs and establish MathDoc as a benchmark for assessing model reliability under degraded document conditions.

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm, enabling models to perform novel visual tasks by learning from in-context examples. The dominant "retrieve-then-prompt" approach typically relies on selecting the single best visual prompt, a practice that often discards valuable contextual information from other suitable candidates. While recent work has explored fusing the top-K prompts into a single, enhanced representation, this still simply collapses multiple rich signals into one, limiting the model's reasoning capability. We argue that a more multi-faceted, collaborative fusion is required to unlock the full potential of these diverse contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that moves beyond single-prompt fusion towards an multi-combination collaborative fusion. Instead of collapsing multiple prompts into one, our method generates three contextual representation branches, each formed by integrating information from different combinations of top-quality prompts. These complementary guidance signals are then fed into proposed MULTI-VQGAN architecture, which is designed to jointly interpret and utilize collaborative information from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization, highlight its strong cross-task generalization, effective contextual fusion, and ability to produce more robust and accurate predictions than existing methods.

Abstract: Vision In-Context Learning (VICL) enables inpainting models to quickly adapt to new visual tasks from only a few prompts. However, existing methods suffer from two key issues: (1) selecting only the most similar prompt discards complementary cues from other high-quality prompts; and (2) failing to exploit the structured information implied by different prompt arrangements.
  We propose an end-to-end VICL framework to overcome these limitations. Firstly, an adaptive Fusion Module aggregates critical patterns and annotations from multiple prompts to form more precise contextual prompts. Secondly, we introduce arrangement-specific lightweight MLPs to decouple layout priors from the core model, while minimally affecting the overall model. In addition, an bidirectional fine-tuning mechanism swaps the roles of query and prompt, encouraging the model to reconstruct the original prompt from fused context and thus enhancing collaboration between the fusion module and the inpainting model. Experiments on foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization demonstrate superior results and strong cross-task generalization of our method.

Abstract: Consistency learning with feature perturbation is a widely used strategy in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. However, many existing perturbation methods rely on dropout, and thus require a careful manual tuning of the dropout rate, which is a sensitive hyperparameter and often difficult to optimize and may lead to suboptimal regularization. To overcome this limitation, we propose VQ-Seg, the first approach to employ vector quantization (VQ) to discretize the feature space and introduce a novel and controllable Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) that replaces dropout. Our QPM perturbs discrete representations by shuffling the spatial locations of codebook indices, enabling effective and controllable regularization. To mitigate potential information loss caused by quantization, we design a dual-branch architecture where the post-quantization feature space is shared by both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Moreover, we introduce a Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) to incorporate guidance from a foundation model (FM), supplementing the high-level semantic information lost during quantization. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale Lung Cancer (LC) dataset comprising 828 CT scans annotated for central-type lung carcinoma. Extensive experiments on the LC dataset and other public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Current multimodal latent reasoning often relies on external supervision (e.g., auxiliary images), ignoring intrinsic visual attention dynamics. In this work, we identify a critical Perception Gap in distillation: student models frequently mimic a teacher's textual output while attending to fundamentally divergent visual regions, effectively relying on language priors rather than grounded perception. To bridge this, we propose LaViT, a framework that aligns latent visual thoughts rather than static embeddings. LaViT compels the student to autoregressively reconstruct the teacher's visual semantics and attention trajectories prior to text generation, employing a curriculum sensory gating mechanism to prevent shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show that LaViT significantly enhances visual grounding, achieving up to +16.9% gains on complex reasoning tasks and enabling a compact 3B model to outperform larger open-source variants and proprietary models like GPT-4o.

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has highlighted their potential for performing complex video understanding tasks. However, in the domain of Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding (VAD&U), existing MLLM-based methods are largely limited to anomaly localization or post-hoc description, lacking explicit reasoning processes, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation. To address this gap, we define a new task termed Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which elevates video anomaly analysis from descriptive understanding to structured, multi-stage reasoning. VAR explicitly requires models to perform progressive reasoning over anomalous events before answering anomaly-related questions, encompassing visual perception, causal interpretation, and risk-aware decision making. To support this task, we present a new dataset with 8,641 videos, where each video is annotated with diverse question types corresponding to different reasoning depths, totaling more than 50,000 samples, making it one of the largest datasets for video anomaly. The annotations are based on a structured Perception-Cognition-Action Chain-of-Thought (PerCoAct-CoT), which formalizes domain-specific reasoning priors for video anomaly understanding. This design enables systematic evaluation of multi-stage and adaptive anomaly reasoning. In addition, we propose Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to further enhance reasoning reliability under weak supervision. Building upon the proposed task and dataset, we develop an end-to-end MLLM-based VAR model termed Vad-R1-Plus, which supports adaptive hierarchical reasoning and risk-aware decision making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed benchmark and method effectively advance the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs on VAR tasks, outperforming both open-source and proprietary baselines.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D Scene Graph (3DSG) generation can enhance various downstream tasks in robotics, such as manipulation and navigation, by leveraging structured semantic representations. A 3DSG is constructed from multiple images of a scene, where objects are represented as nodes and relationships as edges. However, existing works for open-vocabulary 3DSG generation suffer from both low object-level recognition accuracy and speed, mainly due to constrained viewpoints, occlusions, and redundant surface density. To address these challenges, we propose RAG-3DSG to mitigate aggregation noise through re-shot guided uncertainty estimation and support object-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) via reliable low-uncertainty objects. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic downsample-mapping strategy to accelerate cross-image object aggregation with adaptive granularity. Experiments on Replica dataset demonstrate that RAG-3DSG significantly improves node captioning accuracy in 3DSG generation while reducing the mapping time by two-thirds compared to the vanilla version.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to adaptively handle multiple restoration tasks with a single trained model. Although existing methods achieve promising results by introducing prompt information or leveraging large models, the added learning modules increase system complexity and hinder real-time applicability. In this paper, we adopt a physical degradation modeling perspective and predict a task-aware inverse degradation operator for efficient all-in-one image restoration. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, the predicted inverse operator produces an initial restored image together with an uncertainty perception map that highlights regions difficult to reconstruct, ensuring restoration reliability. In the second stage, the restoration is further refined under the guidance of this uncertainty map. The same inverse operator prediction network is used in both stages, with task-aware parameters introduced after operator prediction to adapt to different degradation tasks. Moreover, by accelerating the convolution of the inverse operator, the proposed method achieves efficient all-in-one image restoration. The resulting tightly integrated architecture, termed OPIR, is extensively validated through experiments, demonstrating superior all-in-one restoration performance while remaining highly competitive on task-aligned restoration.

Abstract: We introduce ELITE, an Efficient Gaussian head avatar synthesis from a monocular video via Learned Initialization and TEst-time generative adaptation. Prior works rely either on a 3D data prior or a 2D generative prior to compensate for missing visual cues in monocular videos. However, 3D data prior methods often struggle to generalize in-the-wild, while 2D generative prior methods are computationally heavy and prone to identity hallucination. We identify a complementary synergy between these two priors and design an efficient system that achieves high-fidelity animatable avatar synthesis with strong in-the-wild generalization. Specifically, we introduce a feed-forward Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model (MGPM) that enables fast initialization of a Gaussian avatar. To further bridge the domain gap at test time, we design a test-time generative adaptation stage, leveraging both real and synthetic images as supervision. Unlike previous full diffusion denoising strategies that are slow and hallucination-prone, we propose a rendering-guided single-step diffusion enhancer that restores missing visual details, grounded on Gaussian avatar renderings. Our experiments demonstrate that ELITE produces visually superior avatars to prior works, even for challenging expressions, while achieving 60x faster synthesis than the 2D generative prior method.

Abstract: Camera control has been extensively studied in conditioned video generation; however, performing precisely altering the camera trajectories while faithfully preserving the video content remains a challenging task. The mainstream approach to achieving precise camera control is warping a 3D representation according to the target trajectory. However, such methods fail to fully leverage the 3D priors of video diffusion models (VDMs) and often fall into the Inpainting Trap, resulting in subject inconsistency and degraded generation quality. To address this problem, we propose DepthDirector, a video re-rendering framework with precise camera controllability. By leveraging the depth video from explicit 3D representation as camera-control guidance, our method can faithfully reproduce the dynamic scene of an input video under novel camera trajectories. Specifically, we design a View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism that injects both the source video and the warped depth sequence rendered under the target viewpoint into the pretrained video generation model. This geometric guidance signal enables VDMs to comprehend camera movements and leverage their 3D understanding capabilities, thereby facilitating precise camera control and consistent content generation. Next, we introduce a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter to train our framework, fully preserving the knowledge priors of VDMs. Additionally, we construct a large-scale multi-camera synchronized dataset named MultiCam-WarpData using Unreal Engine 5, containing 8K videos across 1K dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments show that DepthDirector outperforms existing methods in both camera controllability and visual quality. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: Imagine sitting in a presentation, trying to follow the speaker while simultaneously scanning the slides for relevant information. While the entire slide is visible, identifying the relevant regions can be challenging. As you focus on one part of the slide, the speaker moves on to a new sentence, leaving you scrambling to catch up visually. This constant back-and-forth creates a disconnect between what is being said and the most important visual elements, making it hard to absorb key details, especially in fast-paced or content-heavy presentations such as conference talks. This requires an understanding of slides, including text, graphics, and layout. We introduce a method that automatically identifies and highlights the most relevant slide regions based on the speaker's narrative. By analyzing spoken content and matching it with textual or graphical elements in the slides, our approach ensures better synchronization between what listeners hear and what they need to attend to. We explore different ways of solving this problem and assess their success and failure cases. Analyzing multimedia documents is emerging as a key requirement for seamless understanding of content-rich videos, such as educational videos and conference talks, by reducing cognitive strain and improving comprehension.

Abstract: Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models demonstrate strong performance across various downstream tasks by learning from large-scale image-text pairs through contrastive pretraining. The release of extensive English image-text datasets (e.g., COYO-700M and LAION-400M) has enabled widespread adoption of models such as CLIP and SigLIP in tasks including cross-modal retrieval and image captioning. However, the advancement of Chinese vision-language pretraining has substantially lagged behind, due to the scarcity of high-quality Chinese image-text data. To address this gap, we develop a comprehensive pipeline for constructing a high-quality Chinese cross-modal dataset. As a result, we propose DanQing, which contains 100 million image-text pairs collected from Common Crawl. Different from existing datasets, DanQing is curated through a more rigorous selection process, yielding superior data quality. Moreover, DanQing is primarily built from 2024-2025 web data, enabling models to better capture evolving semantic trends and thus offering greater practical utility. We compare DanQing with existing datasets by continual pre-training of the SigLIP2 model. Experimental results show that DanQing consistently achieves superior performance across a range of Chinese downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and LMM-based evaluations. To facilitate further research in Chinese vision-language pre-training, we will open-source the DanQing dataset under the Creative Common CC-BY 4.0 license.

Abstract: Existing adversarial attacks for VLP models are mostly sample-specific, resulting in substantial computational overhead when scaled to large datasets or new scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Refinement Attack (HRA), a multimodal universal attack framework for VLP models. HRA refines universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) at both the sample level and the optimization level. For the image modality, we disentangle adversarial examples into clean images and perturbations, allowing each component to be handled independently for more effective disruption of cross-modal alignment. We further introduce a ScMix augmentation strategy that diversifies visual contexts and strengthens both global and local utility of UAPs, thereby reducing reliance on spurious features. In addition, we refine the optimization path by leveraging a temporal hierarchy of historical and estimated future gradients to avoid local minima and stabilize universal perturbation learning. For the text modality, HRA identifies globally influential words by combining intra-sentence and inter-sentence importance measures, and subsequently utilizes these words as universal text perturbations. Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks, VLP models, and datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed universal multimodal attacks.

Abstract: Recent Omni-multimodal Large Language Models show promise in unified audio, vision, and text modeling. However, streaming audio-video understanding remains challenging, as existing approaches suffer from disjointed capabilities: they typically exhibit incomplete modality support or lack autonomous proactive monitoring. To address this, we present ROMA, a real-time omni-multimodal assistant for unified reactive and proactive interaction. ROMA processes continuous inputs as synchronized multimodal units, aligning dense audio with discrete video frames to handle granularity mismatches. For online decision-making, we introduce a lightweight speak head that decouples response initiation from generation to ensure precise triggering without task conflict. We train ROMA with a curated streaming dataset and a two-stage curriculum that progressively optimizes for streaming format adaptation and proactive responsiveness. To standardize the fragmented evaluation landscape, we reorganize diverse benchmarks into a unified suite covering both proactive (alert, narration) and reactive (QA) settings. Extensive experiments across 12 benchmarks demonstrate ROMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on proactive tasks while competitive in reactive settings, validating its robustness in unified real-time omni-multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery exhibits intrinsic information sparsity due to its unique electromagnetic scattering mechanism. Despite the widespread adoption of deep neural network (DNN)-based SAR automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems, they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples and tend to over-rely on background regions, leading to degraded adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks for SAR-ATR often require visually perceptible distortions to achieve effective performance, thereby necessitating an attack method that balances effectiveness and stealthiness. In this paper, a novel attack method termed Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW) is proposed, which generates adversarial examples through optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets across foreground and background regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRAW significantly degrades the performance of state-of-the-art SAR-ATR models and consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of imperceptibility and adversarial transferability. Code is made available at https://github.com/boremycin/SAR-ATR-TransAttack.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models (DMs) has enabled high-quality visual synthesis from diverse textual prompts. Yet, most existing T2I DMs, even those equipped with large language model (LLM)-based text encoders, remain text-pixel mappers -- they employ LLMs merely as text encoders, without leveraging their inherent reasoning capabilities to infer what should be visually depicted given the textual prompt. To move beyond such literal generation, we propose the think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm, where the LLM-based text encoder is encouraged to reason about and rewrite raw user prompts; the states of the rewritten prompts then serve as diffusion conditioning. To achieve this, we first activate the think-then-rewrite pattern of the LLM encoder with a lightweight supervised fine-tuning process. Subsequently, the LLM encoder and diffusion backbone are co-optimized to ensure faithful reasoning about the context and accurate rendering of the semantics via Dual-GRPO. In particular, the text encoder is reinforced using image-grounded rewards to infer and recall world knowledge, while the diffusion backbone is pushed to produce semantically consistent and visually coherent images. Experiments show substantial improvements in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism across reasoning-based image generation and editing benchmarks, achieving 0.79 on WISE score, nearly on par with GPT-4. Our results constitute a promising step toward next-generation unified models with reasoning, expression, and demonstration capacities.

Abstract: Supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to solve imaging inverse problems, achieving state-of-the-art performance in numerous applications. However, despite their empirical success, these methods are poorly understood from a theoretical perspective and often treated as black boxes. To bridge this gap, we analyze trained neural networks through the lens of the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator, incorporating functional constraints that capture two fundamental inductive biases of CNNs: translation equivariance and locality via finite receptive fields. Under the empirical training distribution, we derive an analytic, interpretable, and tractable formula for this constrained variant, termed Local-Equivariant MMSE (LE-MMSE). Through extensive numerical experiments across various inverse problems (denoising, inpainting, deconvolution), datasets (FFHQ, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST), and architectures (U-Net, ResNet, PatchMLP), we demonstrate that our theory matches the neural networks outputs (PSNR $\gtrsim25$dB). Furthermore, we provide insights into the differences between \emph{physics-aware} and \emph{physics-agnostic} estimators, the impact of high-density regions in the training (patch) distribution, and the influence of other factors (dataset size, patch size, etc).

To address these limitations, we introduce HPE-Bench, a specialized benchmark comprising 1,700 standardized samples from 17 state-of-the-art editing models, offering both authenticity labels and multi-dimensional quality scores. Furthermore, we propose a unified framework based on layer-selective multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By employing contrastive LoRA tuning and a novel layer sensitivity analysis (LSA) mechanism, we identify the optimal feature layer for pose evaluation. Our framework achieves superior performance in both authenticity detection and multi-dimensional quality regression, effectively bridging the gap between forensic detection and quality assessment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based generative priors have enabled visually plausible image compression at extremely low bit rates. However, existing approaches suffer from slow sampling processes and suboptimal bit allocation due to fragmented training paradigms. In this work, we propose Accelerate \textbf{Diff}usion-based Image Compression via \textbf{C}onsistency Prior \textbf{R}efinement (DiffCR), a novel compression framework for efficient and high-fidelity image reconstruction. At the heart of DiffCR is a Frequency-aware Skip Estimation (FaSE) module that refines the $ε$-prediction prior from a pre-trained latent diffusion model and aligns it with compressed latents at different timesteps via Frequency Decoupling Attention (FDA). Furthermore, a lightweight consistency estimator enables fast \textbf{two-step decoding} by preserving the semantic trajectory of diffusion sampling. Without updating the backbone diffusion model, DiffCR achieves substantial bitrate savings (27.2\% BD-rate (LPIPS) and 65.1\% BD-rate (PSNR)) and over $10\times$ speed-up compared to SOTA diffusion-based compression baselines.

Abstract: Recent achievements of vision-language models in end-to-end OCR point to a new avenue for low-loss compression of textual information. This motivates earlier works that render the Transformer's input into images for prefilling, which effectively reduces the number of tokens through visual encoding, thereby alleviating the quadratically increased Attention computations. However, this partial compression fails to save computational or memory costs at token-by-token inference. In this paper, we investigate global context compression, which saves tokens at both prefilling and inference stages. Consequently, we propose VIST2, a novel Transformer that interleaves input text chunks alongside their visual encoding, while depending exclusively on visual tokens in the pre-context to predict the next text token distribution. Around this idea, we render text chunks into sketch images and train VIST2 in multiple stages, starting from curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling, followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning. We conduct extensive experiments using VIST2 families scaled from 0.6B to 8B to explore the training recipe and hyperparameters. With a 4$\times$ compression ratio, the resulting models demonstrate significant superiority over baselines on long writing tasks, achieving, on average, a 3$\times$ speedup in first-token generation, 77% reduction in memory usage, and 74% reduction in FLOPS. Our codes and datasets will be public to support further studies.

Abstract: Accurate survival prediction in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) requires the integration of heterogeneous clinical, radiological, and histopathological information. While Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) offers a promises for precision prognosis and survival prediction, its clinical applicability is severely limited by small cohort sizes and the presence of missing modalities, often forcing complete-case filtering or aggressive imputation. In this work, we present a missing-aware multimodal survival framework that integrates Computed Tomography (CT), Whole-Slide Histopathology (WSI) Images, and structured clinical variables for overall survival modeling in unresectable stage II-III NSCLC. By leveraging Foundation Models (FM) for modality-specific feature extraction and a missing-aware encoding strategy, the proposed approach enables intermediate multimodal fusion under naturally incomplete modality profiles. The proposed architecture is resilient to missing modalities by design, allowing the model to utilize all available data without being forced to drop patients during training or inference. Experimental results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperforms unimodal baselines as well as early and late fusion strategies, with the strongest performance achieved by the fusion of WSI and clinical modalities (73.30 C-index). Further analyses of modality importance reveal an adaptive behavior in which less informative modalities, i.e., CT modality, are automatically down-weighted and contribute less to the final survival prediction.

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is widely employed for the analysis of living biological samples; however, the utility of the resulting recordings is frequently constrained by noise, temporal variability, and inconsistent visualisation of signals that oscillate over time. We present a unique computational framework that integrates information from multiple time-resolved frames into a single high-quality image, while preserving the underlying biological content of the original video. We evaluate the proposed method through an extensive number of configurations (n = 111) and on a challenging dataset comprising dynamic, heterogeneous, and morphologically complex 2D monolayers of cardiac cells. Results show that our framework, which consists of a combination of explainable techniques from different computer vision application fields, is capable of generating composite images that preserve and enhance the quality and information of individual microscopy frames, yielding 44% average increase in cell count compared to previous methods. The proposed pipeline is applicable to other imaging domains that require the fusion of multi-temporal image stacks into high-quality 2D images, thereby facilitating annotation and downstream segmentation.

Abstract: We address the problem of estimating realistic, spatially varying reflectance for complex planetary surfaces such as the lunar regolith, which is critical for high-fidelity rendering and vision-based navigation. Existing lunar rendering pipelines rely on simplified or spatially uniform BRDF models whose parameters are difficult to estimate and fail to capture local reflectance variations, limiting photometric realism. We propose Lunar-G2R, a geometry-to-reflectance learning framework that predicts spatially varying BRDF parameters directly from a lunar digital elevation model (DEM), without requiring multi-view imagery, controlled illumination, or dedicated reflectance-capture hardware at inference time. The method leverages a U-Net trained with differentiable rendering to minimize photometric discrepancies between real orbital images and physically based renderings under known viewing and illumination geometry. Experiments on a geographically held-out region of the Tycho crater show that our approach reduces photometric error by 38 % compared to a state-of-the-art baseline, while achieving higher PSNR and SSIM and improved perceptual similarity, capturing fine-scale reflectance variations absent from spatially uniform models. To our knowledge, this is the first method to infer a spatially varying reflectance model directly from terrain geometry.

Abstract: As hubs of human activity, urban surfaces consist of a wealth of semantic entities. Segmenting these various entities from satellite imagery is crucial for a range of downstream applications. Current advanced segmentation models can reliably segment entities defined by physical attributes (e.g., buildings, water bodies) but still struggle with socially defined categories (e.g., schools, parks). In this work, we achieve socio-semantic segmentation by vision-language model reasoning. To facilitate this, we introduce the Urban Socio-Semantic Segmentation dataset named SocioSeg, a new resource comprising satellite imagery, digital maps, and pixel-level labels of social semantic entities organized in a hierarchical structure. Additionally, we propose a novel vision-language reasoning framework called SocioReasoner that simulates the human process of identifying and annotating social semantic entities via cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning. We employ reinforcement learning to optimize this non-differentiable process and elicit the reasoning capabilities of the vision-language model. Experiments demonstrate our approach's gains over state-of-the-art models and strong zero-shot generalization. Our dataset and code are available in https://github.com/AMAP-ML/SocioReasoner.

Abstract: Fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP often leads to catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge. Prior work primarily aims to mitigate forgetting during adaptation; however, forgetting often remains inevitable during this process. We introduce a novel paradigm, \emph{continued fine-tuning (CFT)}, which seeks to recover pretrained knowledge after a zero-shot model has already been adapted. We propose a simple, model-agnostic CFT strategy (named MERGETUNE) guided by linear mode connectivity (LMC), which can be applied post hoc to existing fine-tuned models without requiring architectural changes. Given a fine-tuned model, we continue fine-tuning its trainable parameters (e.g., soft prompts or linear heads) to search for a continued model which has two low-loss paths to the zero-shot (e.g., CLIP) and the fine-tuned (e.g., CoOp) solutions. By exploiting the geometry of the loss landscape, the continued model implicitly merges the two solutions, restoring pretrained knowledge lost in the fine-tuned counterpart. A challenge is that the vanilla LMC constraint requires data replay from the pretraining task. We approximate this constraint for the zero-shot model via a second-order surrogate, eliminating the need for large-scale data replay. Experiments show that MERGETUNE improves the harmonic mean of CoOp by +5.6\% on base-novel generalisation without adding parameters. % We show \emph{the first time} superior performance than CLIP on both DTD and EuroSAT, on cross-dataset transfer. On robust fine-tuning evaluations, the LMC-merged model from MERGETUNE surpasses ensemble baselines with lower inference cost, achieving further gains and state-of-the-art results when ensembled with the zero-shot model. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/Surrey-UP-Lab/MERGETUNE}{https://github.com/Surrey-UP-Lab/MERGETUNE}.

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction is an essential part of a safe and robust end-to-end autonomous driving (AD) pipeline. Onboard camera-based approaches suffer from limited depth perception and degraded accuracy due to occlusion. In this work, we propose SatMap, an online vectorized HD map estimation method that integrates satellite maps with multi-view camera observations and directly predicts a vectorized HD map for downstream prediction and planning modules. Our method leverages lane-level semantics and texture from satellite imagery captured from a Bird's Eye View (BEV) perspective as a global prior, effectively mitigating depth ambiguity and occlusion. In our experiments on the nuScenes dataset, SatMap achieves 34.8% mAP performance improvement over the camera-only baseline and 8.5% mAP improvement over the camera-LiDAR fusion baseline. Moreover, we evaluate our model in long-range and adverse weather conditions to demonstrate the advantages of using a satellite prior map. Source code will be available at https://iv.ee.hm.edu/satmap/.

Abstract: Anticipating the intentions of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) is a critical challenge for safe autonomous driving (AD) and mobile robotics. While current research predominantly focuses on pedestrian crossing behaviors from a vehicle's perspective, interactions within dense shared spaces remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce FUSE-Bike, the first fully open perception platform of its kind. Equipped with two LiDARs, a camera, and GNSS, it facilitates high-fidelity, close-range data capture directly from a cyclist's viewpoint. Leveraging this platform, we present BikeActions, a novel multi-modal dataset comprising 852 annotated samples across 5 distinct action classes, specifically tailored to improve VRU behavior modeling. We establish a rigorous benchmark by evaluating state-of-the-art graph convolution and transformer-based models on our publicly released data splits, establishing the first performance baselines for this challenging task. We release the full dataset together with data curation tools, the open hardware design, and the benchmark code to foster future research in VRU action understanding under https://iv.ee.hm.edu/bikeactions/.

Abstract: The automated creation of digital twins and precise asset inventories is a critical task in smart city construction and facility lifecycle management. However, utilizing cost-effective sparse imagery remains challenging due to limited robustness, inaccurate localization, and a lack of fine-grained state understanding. To address these limitations, SVII-3D, a unified framework for holistic asset digitization, is proposed. First, LoRA fine-tuned open-set detection is fused with a spatial-attention matching network to robustly associate observations across sparse views. Second, a geometry-guided refinement mechanism is introduced to resolve structural errors, achieving precise decimeter-level 3D localization. Third, transcending static geometric mapping, a Vision-Language Model agent leveraging multi-modal prompting is incorporated to automatically diagnose fine-grained operational states. Experiments demonstrate that SVII-3D significantly improves identification accuracy and minimizes localization errors. Consequently, this framework offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for high-fidelity infrastructure digitization, effectively bridging the gap between sparse perception and automated intelligent maintenance.

Abstract: Images captured in hazy and smoky environments suffer from reduced visibility, posing a challenge when monitoring infrastructures and hindering emergency services during critical situations. The proposed work investigates the use of the deep learning models to enhance the automatic, machine-based readability of gauge in smoky environments, with accurate gauge data interpretation serving as a valuable tool for first responders. The study utilizes two deep learning architectures, FFA-Net and AECR-Net, to improve the visibility of gauge images, corrupted with light up to dense haze and smoke. Since benchmark datasets of analog gauge images are unavailable, a new synthetic dataset, containing over 14,000 images, was generated using the Unreal Engine. The models were trained with an 80\% train, 10\% validation, and 10\% test split for the haze and smoke dataset, respectively. For the synthetic haze dataset, the SSIM and PSNR metrics are about 0.98 and 43\,dB, respectively, comparing well to state-of-the art results. Additionally, more robust results are retrieved from the AECR-Net, when compared to the FFA-Net. Although the results from the synthetic smoke dataset are poorer, the trained models achieve interesting results. In general, imaging in the presence of smoke are more difficult to enhance given the inhomogeneity and high density. Secondly, FFA-Net and AECR-Net are implemented to dehaze and not to desmoke images. This work shows that use of deep learning architectures can improve the quality of analog gauge images captured in smoke and haze scenes immensely. Finally, the enhanced output images can be successfully post-processed for automatic autonomous reading of gauges

Abstract: Automated perception of urban roadside infrastructure is crucial for smart city management, yet general-purpose models often struggle to capture the necessary fine-grained attributes and domain rules. While Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at open-world recognition, they often struggle to accurately interpret complex facility states in compliance with engineering standards, leading to unreliable performance in real-world applications. To address this, we propose a domain-adapted framework that transforms VLMs into specialized agents for intelligent infrastructure analysis. Our approach integrates a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy with a knowledge-grounded reasoning mechanism. Specifically, we leverage open-vocabulary fine-tuning on Grounding DINO to robustly localize diverse assets with minimal supervision, followed by LoRA-based adaptation on Qwen-VL for deep semantic attribute reasoning. To mitigate hallucinations and enforce professional compliance, we introduce a dual-modality Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that dynamically retrieves authoritative industry standards and visual exemplars during inference. Evaluated on a comprehensive new dataset of urban roadside scenes, our framework achieves a detection performance of 58.9 mAP and an attribute recognition accuracy of 95.5%, demonstrating a robust solution for intelligent infrastructure monitoring.

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models produce promising visual content yet often violate basic physics principles, limiting their utility. While some attribute this deficiency to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, we find that the shortfall in physics plausibility also stems from suboptimal inference strategies. We therefore introduce WMReward and treat improving physics plausibility of video generation as an inference-time alignment problem. In particular, we leverage the strong physics prior of a latent world model (here, VJEPA-2) as a reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better generation performance. Empirically, our approach substantially improves physics plausibility across image-conditioned, multiframe-conditioned, and text-conditioned generation settings, with validation from human preference study. Notably, in the ICCV 2025 Perception Test PhysicsIQ Challenge, we achieve a final score of 62.64%, winning first place and outperforming the previous state of the art by 7.42%. Our work demonstrates the viability of using latent world models to improve physics plausibility of video generation, beyond this specific instantiation or parameterization.

Abstract: The efficacy of autonomous driving systems hinges critically on robust prediction and planning capabilities. However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a central role in computer vision. However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.
  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $β_0 = β_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.
  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved.

Abstract: The paper introduces a white-box attack on computer vision models using SHAP values. It demonstrates how adversarial evasion attacks can compromise the performance of deep learning models by reducing output confidence or inducing misclassifications. Such attacks are particularly insidious as they can deceive the perception of an algorithm while eluding human perception due to their imperceptibility to the human eye. The proposed attack leverages SHAP values to quantify the significance of individual inputs to the output at the inference stage. A comparison is drawn between the SHAP attack and the well-known Fast Gradient Sign Method. We find evidence that SHAP attacks are more robust in generating misclassifications particularly in gradient hiding scenarios.

Abstract: Talking head generation is increasingly important in virtual reality (VR), especially for social scenarios involving multi-turn conversation. Existing approaches face notable limitations: mesh-based 3D methods can model dual-person dialogue but lack realistic textures, while large-model-based 2D methods produce natural appearances but incur prohibitive computational costs. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based methods achieve efficient and realistic rendering but remain speaker-only and ignore social relationships. We introduce RSATalker, the first framework that leverages 3DGS for realistic and socially-aware talking head generation with support for multi-turn conversation. Our method first drives mesh-based 3D facial motion from speech, then binds 3D Gaussians to mesh facets to render high-fidelity 2D avatar videos. To capture interpersonal dynamics, we propose a socially-aware module that encodes social relationships, including blood and non-blood as well as equal and unequal, into high-level embeddings through a learnable query mechanism. We design a three-stage training paradigm and construct the RSATalker dataset with speech-mesh-image triplets annotated with social relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSATalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in both realism and social awareness. The code and dataset will be released.

Abstract: Today's strongest video-language models (VLMs) remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos.

Abstract: In this paper, we find that the generation of 3D human motions and 2D human videos is intrinsically coupled. 3D motions provide the structural prior for plausibility and consistency in videos, while pre-trained video models offer strong generalization capabilities for motions, which necessitate coupling their generation processes. Based on this, we present CoMoVi, a co-generative framework that couples two video diffusion models (VDMs) to generate 3D human motions and videos synchronously within a single diffusion denoising loop. To achieve this, we first propose an effective 2D human motion representation that can inherit the powerful prior of pre-trained VDMs. Then, we design a dual-branch diffusion model to couple human motion and video generation process with mutual feature interaction and 3D-2D cross attentions. Moreover, we curate CoMoVi Dataset, a large-scale real-world human video dataset with text and motion annotations, covering diverse and challenging human motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both 3D human motion and video generation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video models have shown tremendous progress, particularly in long video understanding. However, current benchmarks predominantly feature western-centric data and English as the dominant language, introducing significant biases in evaluation. To address this, we introduce CURVE (Cultural Understanding and Reasoning in Video Evaluation), a challenging benchmark for multicultural and multilingual video reasoning. CURVE comprises high-quality, entirely human-generated annotations from diverse, region-specific cultural videos across 18 global locales. Unlike prior work that relies on automatic translations, CURVE provides complex questions, answers, and multi-step reasoning steps, all crafted in native languages. Making progress on CURVE requires a deeply situated understanding of visual cultural context. Furthermore, we leverage CURVE's reasoning traces to construct evidence-based graphs and propose a novel iterative strategy using these graphs to identify fine-grained errors in reasoning. Our evaluations reveal that SoTA Video-LLMs struggle significantly, performing substantially below human-level accuracy, with errors primarily stemming from the visual perception of cultural elements. CURVE will be publicly available under https://github.com/google-deepmind/neptune?tab=readme-ov-file\#minerva-cultural

Abstract: Despite the ecological significance of invertebrates, global trait databases remain heavily biased toward vertebrates and plants, limiting comprehensive ecological analyses of high-diversity groups like ground beetles. Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) serve as critical bioindicators of ecosystem health, providing valuable insights into biodiversity shifts driven by environmental changes. While the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) maintains an extensive collection of carabid specimens from across the United States, these primarily exist as physical collections, restricting widespread research access and large-scale analysis. To address these gaps, we present a multimodal dataset digitizing over 13,200 NEON carabids from 30 sites spanning the continental US and Hawaii through high-resolution imaging, enabling broader access and computational analysis. The dataset includes digitally measured elytra length and width of each specimen, establishing a foundation for automated trait extraction using AI. Validated against manual measurements, our digital trait extraction achieves sub-millimeter precision, ensuring reliability for ecological and computational studies. By addressing invertebrate under-representation in trait databases, this work supports AI-driven tools for automated species identification and trait-based research, fostering advancements in biodiversity monitoring and conservation.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving show that policies trained on patch-aligned features extracted from foundation models generalize better to Out-of-Distribution (OOD). We hypothesize that due to the self-attention mechanism, each patch feature implicitly embeds/contains information from all other patches, represented in a different way and intensity, making these descriptors highly redundant. We quantify redundancy in such (BLIP2) features via PCA and cross-patch similarity: $90$% of variance is captured by $17/64$ principal components, and strong inter-token correlations are pervasive. Training on such overlapping information leads the policy to overfit spurious correlations, hurting OOD robustness. We present Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS), a simple yet effective approach for learning policies that are more robust, generalizable, and efficient. For every frame, SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors, not feeding them to the policy model, while preserving the spatial layout of the remaining patches. Thus, the policy is provided with different stochastic but complete views of the (same) scene: every random subset of patches acts like a different, yet still sensible, coherent projection of the world. The policy thus bases its decisions on features that are invariant to which specific tokens survive. Extensive experiments confirm that across all OOD scenarios, our method outperforms the state of the art (SOTA), achieving a $6.2$% average improvement and up to $20.4$% in closed-loop simulations, while being $2.4\times$ faster. We conduct ablations over masking rates and patch-feature reorganization, training and evaluating 9 systems, with 8 of them surpassing prior SOTA. Finally, we show that the same learned policy transfers to a physical, real-world car without any tuning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) create a severe visual feature bottleneck by using a crude, asymmetric connection that links only the output of the vision encoder to the input of the large language model (LLM). This static architecture fundamentally limits the ability of LLMs to achieve comprehensive alignment with hierarchical visual knowledge, compromising their capacity to accurately integrate local details with global semantics into coherent reasoning. To resolve this, we introduce Cross-Layer Injection (CLI), a novel and lightweight framework that forges a dynamic many-to-many bridge between the two modalities. CLI consists of two synergistic, parameter-efficient components: an Adaptive Multi-Projection (AMP) module that harmonizes features from diverse vision layers, and an Adaptive Gating Fusion (AGF) mechanism that empowers the LLM to selectively inject the most relevant visual information based on its real-time decoding context. We validate the effectiveness and versatility of CLI by integrating it into LLaVA-OneVision and LLaVA-1.5. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements, establishing CLI as a scalable paradigm that unlocks deeper multimodal understanding by granting LLMs on-demand access to the full visual hierarchy.

Abstract: We introduce Alterbute, a diffusion-based method for editing an object's intrinsic attributes in an image. We allow changing color, texture, material, and even the shape of an object, while preserving its perceived identity and scene context. Existing approaches either rely on unsupervised priors that often fail to preserve identity or use overly restrictive supervision that prevents meaningful intrinsic variations. Our method relies on: (i) a relaxed training objective that allows the model to change both intrinsic and extrinsic attributes conditioned on an identity reference image, a textual prompt describing the target intrinsic attributes, and a background image and object mask defining the extrinsic context. At inference, we restrict extrinsic changes by reusing the original background and object mask, thereby ensuring that only the desired intrinsic attributes are altered; (ii) Visual Named Entities (VNEs) - fine-grained visual identity categories (e.g., ''Porsche 911 Carrera'') that group objects sharing identity-defining features while allowing variation in intrinsic attributes. We use a vision-language model to automatically extract VNE labels and intrinsic attribute descriptions from a large public image dataset, enabling scalable, identity-preserving supervision. Alterbute outperforms existing methods on identity-preserving object intrinsic attribute editing.

Abstract: We present WildRayZer, a self-supervised framework for novel view synthesis (NVS) in dynamic environments where both the camera and objects move. Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS. Experiments show that WildRayZer consistently outperforms optimization-based and feed-forward baselines in both transient-region removal and full-frame NVS quality with a single feed-forward pass.

Abstract: Veterinary electronic health records (vEHRs) contain privacy-sensitive identifiers that limit secondary use. While PetEVAL provides a benchmark for veterinary de-identification, the domain remains low-resource. This study evaluates whether large language model (LLM)-generated synthetic narratives improve de-identification safety under distinct training regimes, emphasizing (i) synthetic augmentation and (ii) fixed-budget substitution. We conducted a controlled simulation using a PetEVAL-derived corpus (3,750 holdout/1,249 train). We generated 10,382 synthetic notes using a privacy-preserving "template-only" regime where identifiers were removed prior to LLM prompting. Three transformer backbones (PetBERT, VetBERT, Bio_ClinicalBERT) were trained under varying mixtures. Evaluation prioritized document-level leakage rate (the fraction of documents with at least one missed identifier) as the primary safety outcome. Results show that under fixed-sample substitution, replacing real notes with synthetic ones monotonically increased leakage, indicating synthetic data cannot safely replace real supervision. Under compute-matched training, moderate synthetic mixing matched real-only performance, but high synthetic dominance degraded utility. Conversely, epoch-scaled augmentation improved performance: PetBERT span-overlap F1 increased from 0.831 to 0.850 +/- 0.014, and leakage decreased from 6.32% to 4.02% +/- 0.19%. However, these gains largely reflect increased training exposure rather than intrinsic synthetic data quality. Corpus diagnostics revealed systematic synthetic-real mismatches in note length and label distribution that align with persistent leakage. We conclude that synthetic augmentation is effective for expanding exposure but is complementary, not substitutive, for safety-critical veterinary de-identification.

Abstract: Many Ethereum smart contracts rely on block attributes such as block.timestamp or blockhash to generate random numbers for applications like lotteries and games. However, these values are predictable and miner-manipulable, creating the Bad Randomness vulnerability (SWC-120) that has led to real-world exploits. Current detection tools identify only simple patterns and fail to verify whether protective modifiers actually guard vulnerable code. A major obstacle to improving these tools is the lack of large, accurately labeled datasets. This paper presents a benchmark dataset of 1,752 Ethereum smart contracts with validated Bad Randomness vulnerabilities. We developed a five-phase methodology comprising keyword filtering, pattern matching with 58 regular expressions, risk classification, function-level validation, and context analysis. The function-level validation revealed that 49% of contracts initially classified as protected were actually exploitable because modifiers were applied to different functions than those containing vulnerabilities. We classify contracts into four risk levels based on exploitability: HIGH_RISK (no protection), MEDIUM_RISK (miner-exploitable only), LOW_RISK (owner-exploitable only), and SAFE (using Chainlink VRF or commit-reveal). Our dataset is 51 times larger than RNVulDet and the first to provide function-level validation and risk stratification. Evaluation of Slither and Mythril revealed significant detection gaps, as both tools identified none of the vulnerable contracts in our sample, indicating limitations in handling complex randomness patterns. The dataset and validation scripts are publicly available to support future research in smart contract security.

Abstract: Passive eavesdropping compromises confidentiality in wireless networks, especially in resource-constrained environments where heavyweight cryptography is impractical. Physical layer security (PLS) exploits channel randomness and spatial selectivity to confine information to an intended receiver with modest overhead. However, typical PLS techniques, such as using beamforming, artificial noise, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, often involve added active power or specialized deployment, and, in many designs, rely on precise time synchronization and perfect CSI estimation, which limits their practicality. To this end, we propose AmbShield, an AmBD-assisted PLS scheme that leverages naturally distributed AmBDs to simultaneously strengthen the legitimate channel and degrade eavesdroppers' without requiring extra transmit power and with minimal deployment overhead. In AmbShield, AmBDs are exploited as friendly jammers that randomly backscatter to create interference at eavesdroppers, and as passive relays that backscatter the desired signal to enhance the capacity of legitimate devices. We further develop a unified analytical framework that analyzes the exact probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of legitimate and eavesdropper signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR), and a closed-form secrecy outage probability (SOP). The analysis provides clear design guidelines on various practical system parameters to minimize SOP. Extensive experiments that include Monte Carlo simulations, theoretical derivations, and high-SNR asymptotic analysis demonstrate the security gains of AmbShield across diverse system parameters under imperfect synchronization and CSI estimation.

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in network intrusion detection; however, its performance significantly degrades when confronted by a new attack class -- a zero-day attack. In simple terms, classical machine learning-based approaches are adept at identifying attack classes on which they have been previously trained, but struggle with those not included in their training data. One approach to addressing this shortcoming is to utilise anomaly detectors which train exclusively on benign data with the goal of generalising to all attack classes -- both known and zero-day. However, this comes at the expense of a prohibitively high false positive rate. This work proposes a novel contrastive loss function which is able to maintain the advantages of other contrastive learning-based approaches (robustness to imbalanced data) but can also generalise to zero-day attacks. Unlike anomaly detectors, this model learns the distributions of benign traffic using both benign and known malign samples, i.e. other well-known attack classes (not including the zero-day class), and consequently, achieves significant performance improvements. The proposed approach is experimentally verified on the Lycos2017 dataset where it achieves an AUROC improvement of .000065 and .060883 over previous models in known and zero-day attack detection, respectively. Finally, the proposed method is extended to open-set recognition achieving OpenAUC improvements of .170883 over existing approaches.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in healthcare to support clinical decision-making, summarize electronic health records (EHRs), and enhance patient care. However, this integration introduces significant privacy and security challenges, driven by the sensitivity of clinical data and the high-stakes nature of medical workflows. These risks become even more pronounced across heterogeneous deployment environments, ranging from small on-premise hospital systems to regional health networks, each with unique resource limitations and regulatory demands. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) examines the evolving threat landscape across the three core LLM phases: Data preprocessing, Fine-tuning, and Inference within realistic healthcare settings. We present a detailed threat model that characterizes adversaries, capabilities, and attack surfaces at each phase, and we systematize how existing privacy-preserving techniques (PPTs) attempt to mitigate these vulnerabilities. While existing defenses show promise, our analysis identifies persistent limitations in securing sensitive clinical data across diverse operational tiers. We conclude with phase-aware recommendations and future research directions aimed at strengthening privacy guarantees for LLMs in regulated environments. This work provides a foundation for understanding the intersection of LLMs, threats, and privacy in healthcare, offering a roadmap toward more robust and clinically trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on sensitive data poses significant privacy risks, as membership inference attacks can reveal whether individual records were used during training. While Differential Privacy (DP) provides formal protection, applying DP to conventional Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) often incurs substantial utility loss. In this work, we show that a more structurally constrained PEFT architecture, Tensor Train Low-Rank Adaptation (TTLoRA), can improve the privacy-utility tradeoff by shrinking the effective parameter space while preserving expressivity. To this end, we develop TTLoRA-DP, a differentially private training framework for TTLoRA. Specifically, we extend the ghost clipping algorithm to Tensor Train cores via cached contraction states, enabling efficient Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) with exact per-example gradient norm computation without materializing full per-example gradients. Experiments on GPT-2 fine-tuning over the Enron and Penn Treebank datasets show that TTLoRA-DP consistently strengthens privacy protection relative to LoRA-DP while maintaining comparable or better downstream utility. Moreover, TTLoRA exhibits lower membership leakage even without DP training, using substantially smaller adapters and requiring on average 7.6X fewer parameters than LoRA. Overall, our results demonstrate that TTLoRA offers a practical path to improving the privacy-utility tradeoff in parameter-efficient language model adaptation.

Abstract: The rapid integration of IoT with edge computing has revolutionized various domains, particularly healthcare, by enabling real-time data sharing, remote monitoring, and decision-making. However, it introduces critical challenges, including data privacy breaches, security vulnerabilities, especially in environments dealing with sensitive information. Traditional access control mechanisms and centralized security systems do not address these issues, leaving IoT environments exposed to unauthorized access and data misuse. This research proposes Fuzzychain-edge, a novel Fuzzy logic-based adaptive Access control model for Blockchain in Edge Computing framework designed to overcome these limitations by incorporating Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), fuzzy logic, and smart contracts. ZKPs secure sensitive data during access control processes by enabling verification without revealing confidential details, thereby ensuring user privacy. Fuzzy logic facilitates adaptive, context-aware decision-making for access control by dynamically evaluating parameters such as data sensitivity, trust levels, and user roles. Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable architecture, ensures transparency, traceability, and accountability using smart contracts that automate access control processes. The proposed framework addresses key challenges by enhancing security, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access, and providing a transparent audit trail of data transactions. Expected outcomes include improved data privacy, accuracy in access control, and increased user trust in IoT systems. This research contributes significantly to advancing privacy-preserving, secure, and traceable solutions in IoT environments, laying the groundwork for future innovations in decentralized technologies and their applications in critical domains such as healthcare and beyond.

Abstract: Encryption and Decryption is the process of sending a message in a ciphered way that appears meaningless and could be deciphered using a key for security purposes to avoid data breaches. This paper expands on the previous work on Sudoku-based encryption methods, applying it to other forms of media including images, audio and video. It also enhances the security of key generation and usage by making it dependent on the timestamp of when the message was transmitted. It is a versatile system that works on multimodal data and functions as a block-based transposition cipher. Instead of shuffling, it can also employ substitution methods like XOR, making it a substitution cipher. The resulting media are highly encrypted and resilient to brute-force and differential attacks. For images, NPCR values approach 100% and for audio, SNR values exceed 60dB. This makes the encrypted audio significantly different from the source, making decryption more difficult.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the development of powerful agentic systems capable of automating complex workflows across various fields. However, these systems are highly vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, where malicious instructions embedded in external data can hijack agent behavior. In this work, we present ReasAlign, a model-level solution to improve safety alignment against indirect prompt injection attacks. The core idea of ReasAlign is to incorporate structured reasoning steps to analyze user queries, detect conflicting instructions, and preserve the continuity of the user's intended tasks to defend against indirect injection attacks. To further ensure reasoning logic and accuracy, we introduce a test-time scaling mechanism with a preference-optimized judge model that scores reasoning steps and selects the best trajectory. Comprehensive evaluations across various benchmarks show that ReasAlign maintains utility comparable to an undefended model while consistently outperforming Meta SecAlign, the strongest prior guardrail. On the representative open-ended CyberSecEval2 benchmark, which includes multiple prompt-injected tasks, ReasAlign achieves 94.6% utility and only 3.6% ASR, far surpassing the state-of-the-art defensive model of Meta SecAlign (56.4% utility and 74.4% ASR). These results demonstrate that ReasAlign achieves the best trade-off between security and utility, establishing a robust and practical defense against prompt injection attacks in real-world agentic systems.

Abstract: The prevalence of recommendation systems also brings privacy concerns to both the users and the sellers, as centralized platforms collect as much data as possible from them. To keep the data private, we propose PADER: a Paillier-based secure decentralized social recommendation system. In this system, the users and the sellers are nodes in a decentralized network. The training and inference of the recommendation model are carried out securely in a decentralized manner, without the involvement of a centralized platform. To this end, we apply the Paillier cryptosystem to the SoReg (Social Regularization) model, which exploits both user's ratings and social relations. We view the SoReg model as a two-party secure polynomial evaluation problem and observe that the simple bipartite computation may result in poor efficiency. To improve efficiency, we design secure addition and multiplication protocols to support secure computation on any arithmetic circuit, along with an optimal data packing scheme that is suitable for the polynomial computations of real values. Experiment results show that our method only takes about one second to iterate through one user with hundreds of ratings, and training with ~500K ratings for one epoch only takes <3 hours, which shows that the method is practical in real applications. The code is available at https://github.com/GarminQ/PADER.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Virtualization-based binary obfuscation is widely adopted to protect software intellectual property, yet existing approaches leave exception-handling (EH) metadata unprotected to preserve ABI compatibility. This exposed metadata leaks rich structural information, such as stack layouts, control-flow boundaries, and object lifetimes, which can be exploited to facilitate reverse engineering. In this paper, we present XuanJia, a comprehensive VM-based binary obfuscation framework that provides end-to-end protection for both executable code and exception-handling semantics. At the core of XuanJia is ABI-Compliant EH Shadowing, a novel exception-aware protection mechanism that preserves compatibility with unmodified operating system runtimes while eliminating static EH metadata leakage. XuanJia replaces native EH metadata with ABI-compliant shadow unwind information to satisfy OS-driven unwinding, and securely redirects exception handling into a protected virtual machine where the genuine EH semantics are decrypted, reversed, and replayed using obfuscated code. We implement XuanJia from scratch, supporting 385 x86 instruction encodings and 155 VM handler templates, and design it as an extensible research testbed. We evaluate XuanJia across correctness, resilience, and performance dimensions. Our results show that XuanJia preserves semantic equivalence under extensive dynamic and symbolic testing, effectively disrupts automated reverse-engineering tools such as IDA Pro, and incurs negligible space overhead and modest runtime overhead.

Abstract: Current LLM safety research predominantly focuses on mitigating Goal Hijacking, preventing attackers from redirecting a model's high-level objective (e.g., from "summarizing emails" to "phishing users"). In this paper, we argue that this perspective is incomplete and highlight a critical vulnerability in Reasoning Alignment. We propose a new adversarial paradigm: Reasoning Hijacking and instantiate it with Criteria Attack, which subverts model judgments by injecting spurious decision criteria without altering the high-level task goal. Unlike Goal Hijacking, which attempts to override the system prompt, Reasoning Hijacking accepts the high-level goal but manipulates the model's decision-making logic by injecting spurious reasoning shortcut. Though extensive experiments on three different tasks (toxic comment, negative review, and spam detection), we demonstrate that even newest models are prone to prioritize injected heuristic shortcuts over rigorous semantic analysis. The results are consistent over different backbones. Crucially, because the model's "intent" remains aligned with the user's instructions, these attacks can bypass defenses designed to detect goal deviation (e.g., SecAlign, StruQ), exposing a fundamental blind spot in the current safety landscape.

Abstract: The rise of AI agent frameworks has introduced agent skills, modular packages containing instructions and executable code that dynamically extend agent capabilities. While this architecture enables powerful customization, skills execute with implicit trust and minimal vetting, creating a significant yet uncharacterized attack surface. We conduct the first large-scale empirical security analysis of this emerging ecosystem, collecting 42,447 skills from two major marketplaces and systematically analyzing 31,132 using SkillScan, a multi-stage detection framework integrating static analysis with LLM-based semantic classification. Our findings reveal pervasive security risks: 26.1% of skills contain at least one vulnerability, spanning 14 distinct patterns across four categories: prompt injection, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, and supply chain risks. Data exfiltration (13.3%) and privilege escalation (11.8%) are most prevalent, while 5.2% of skills exhibit high-severity patterns strongly suggesting malicious intent. We find that skills bundling executable scripts are 2.12x more likely to contain vulnerabilities than instruction-only skills (OR=2.12, p<0.001). Our contributions include: (1) a grounded vulnerability taxonomy derived from 8,126 vulnerable skills, (2) a validated detection methodology achieving 86.7% precision and 82.5% recall, and (3) an open dataset and detection toolkit to support future research. These results demonstrate an urgent need for capability-based permission systems and mandatory security vetting before this attack vector is further exploited.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) agents are increasingly used in a variety of domains to automate tasks, interact with users, and make decisions based on data inputs. Ensuring that AI agents perform only authorized actions and handle inputs appropriately is essential for maintaining system integrity and preventing misuse. In this study, we introduce the AgentGuardian, a novel security framework that governs and protects AI agent operations by enforcing context-aware access-control policies. During a controlled staging phase, the framework monitors execution traces to learn legitimate agent behaviors and input patterns. From this phase, it derives adaptive policies that regulate tool calls made by the agent, guided by both real-time input context and the control flow dependencies of multi-step agent actions. Evaluation across two real-world AI agent applications demonstrates that AgentGuardian effectively detects malicious or misleading inputs while preserving normal agent functionality. Moreover, its control-flow-based governance mechanism mitigates hallucination-driven errors and other orchestration-level malfunctions.

Abstract: Certified deletion allows Alice to outsource data to Bob and, at a later time, obtain a verifiable guarantee that the file has been irreversibly deleted at her request. The functionality, while impossible using classical information alone, can be achieved using quantum information. Existing approaches, rely on one-time pad (OTP) encryption, or use computational hardness assumptions that may be vulnerable to future advances in classical or quantum computing. In this work, we introduce and formalize hybrid encryption with certified deletion in the preprocessing model (pHE-CD) and propose two constructions. The constructions combine an information-theoretic key encapsulation mechanism (iKEM) with a data encapsulation mechanism that provides certified deletion (DEM-CD) and, respectively, provide {\em information-theoretic certified deletion}, where both confidentiality and deletion properties are provided against a computationally unbounded adversary; and {\em everlasting certified deletion}, where confidentiality is computational before deletion, and upon successful verification of the deletion certificate, the message becomes information-theoretically hidden from an adversary that is computationally unbounded. Our pHE-CD schemes provide IND-$q_e$-CPA notion of security and support encryption of arbitrarily long messages. In the second construction, using a computationally secure DEM-CD that is quantum-safe (i.e. constructed using quantum coding and AES), we obtain quantum-safe security with keys that are significantly shorter than the message. Instantiating the proposed framework using quantum enabled kem (qKEM) as the iKEM, is a future work.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities but remain vulnerable to adversarial ``jailbreak'' attacks designed to bypass safety guardrails. Current safety alignment methods depend heavily on static external red teaming, utilizing fixed defense prompts or pre-collected adversarial datasets. This leads to a rigid defense that overfits known patterns and fails to generalize to novel, sophisticated threats. To address this critical limitation, we propose empowering the model to be its own red teamer, capable of achieving autonomous and evolving adversarial attacks. Specifically, we introduce Safety Self- Play (SSP), a system that utilizes a single LLM to act concurrently as both the Attacker (generating jailbreaks) and the Defender (refusing harmful requests) within a unified Reinforcement Learning (RL) loop, dynamically evolving attack strategies to uncover vulnerabilities while simultaneously strengthening defense mechanisms. To ensure the Defender effectively addresses critical safety issues during the self-play, we introduce an advanced Reflective Experience Replay Mechanism, which uses an experience pool accumulated throughout the process. The mechanism employs a Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) sampling strategy to focus on failure cases with low rewards, helping the model learn from past hard mistakes while balancing exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SSP approach autonomously evolves robust defense capabilities, significantly outperforming baselines trained on static adversarial datasets and establishing a new benchmark for proactive safety alignment.

Abstract: Social Determinants of Health correlate with patient outcomes but are rarely captured in structured data. Recent attention has been given to automatically extracting these markers from clinical text to supplement diagnostic systems with knowledge of patients' social circumstances. Large language models demonstrate strong performance in identifying Social Determinants of Health labels from sentences. However, prediction in large admissions or longitudinal notes is challenging given long distance dependencies. In this paper, we explore hospital admission multi-label Social Determinants of Health ICD-9 code classification on the MIMIC-III dataset using reasoning models and traditional large language models. We exploit existing ICD-9 codes for prediction on admissions, which achieved an 89% F1. Our contributions include our findings, missing SDoH codes in 139 admissions, and code to reproduce the results.

Abstract: We prove that the Transformer self-attention mechanism in the high-confidence regime ($β\to \infty$, where $β$ is an inverse temperature) operates in the tropical semiring (max-plus algebra). In particular, we show that taking the tropical limit of the softmax attention converts it into a tropical matrix product. This reveals that the Transformer's forward pass is effectively executing a dynamic programming recurrence (specifically, a Bellman-Ford path-finding update) on a latent graph defined by token similarities. Our theoretical result provides a new geometric perspective for chain-of-thought reasoning: it emerges from an inherent shortest-path (or longest-path) algorithm being carried out within the network's computation.

Abstract: As black box models and pretrained models gain traction in time series applications, understanding and explaining their predictions becomes increasingly vital, especially in high-stakes domains where interpretability and trust are essential. However, most of the existing methods involve only in-distribution explanation, and do not generalize outside the training support, which requires the learning capability of generalization. In this work, we aim to provide a framework to explain black-box models for time series data through the dual lenses of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and causality. We show that many current explanation methods are sensitive to distributional shifts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Building on the concept of Sparse Autoencoder, we introduce TimeSAE, a framework for black-box model explanation. We conduct extensive evaluations of TimeSAE on both synthetic and real-world time series datasets, comparing it to leading baselines. The results, supported by both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights, show that TimeSAE provides more faithful and robust explanations. Our code is available in an easy-to-use library TimeSAE-Lib: https://anonymous.4open.science/w/TimeSAE-571D/.

Abstract: Organizations and enterprises across domains such as healthcare, finance, and scientific research are increasingly required to extract collective intelligence from distributed, siloed datasets while adhering to strict privacy, regulatory, and sovereignty requirements. Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model building without sharing sensitive raw data, but faces growing challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity, system diversity, and the computational burden from complex models. This study examines the potential of quantum-assisted federated learning, which could cut the number of parameters in classical models by polylogarithmic factors and thus lessen training overhead. Accordingly, we introduce QFed, a quantum-enabled federated learning framework aimed at boosting computational efficiency across edge device networks. We evaluate the proposed framework using the widely adopted FashionMNIST dataset. Experimental results show that QFed achieves a 77.6% reduction in the parameter count of a VGG-like model while maintaining an accuracy comparable to classical approaches in a scalable environment. These results point to the potential of leveraging quantum computing within a federated learning context to strengthen FL capabilities of edge devices.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover ``what causes what'', but classical constraint-based methods (e.g., PC, FCI) suffer from error propagation, and recent LLM-based causal oracles often behave as opaque, confidence-free black boxes. This paper introduces Tree-Query, a tree-structured, multi-expert LLM framework that reduces pairwise causal discovery to a short sequence of queries about backdoor paths, (in)dependence, latent confounding, and causal direction, yielding interpretable judgments with robustness-aware confidence scores. Theoretical guarantees are provided for asymptotic identifiability of four pairwise relations. On data-free benchmarks derived from Mooij et al. and UCI causal graphs, Tree-Query improves structural metrics over direct LLM baselines, and a diet--weight case study illustrates confounder screening and stable, high-confidence causal conclusions. Tree-Query thus offers a principled way to obtain data-free causal priors from LLMs that can complement downstream data-driven causal discovery.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: When training machine learning (ML) models for potential deployment in a healthcare setting, it is essential to ensure that they do not replicate or exacerbate existing healthcare biases. Although many definitions of fairness exist, we focus on path-specific causal fairness, which allows us to better consider the social and medical contexts in which biases occur (e.g., direct discrimination by a clinician or model versus bias due to differential access to the healthcare system) and to characterize how these biases may appear in learned models. In this work, we map the structural fairness model to the observational healthcare setting and create a generalizable pipeline for training causally fair models. The pipeline explicitly considers specific healthcare context and disparities to define a target "fair" model. Our work fills two major gaps: first, we expand on characterizations of the "fairness-accuracy" tradeoff by detangling direct and indirect sources of bias and jointly presenting these fairness considerations alongside considerations of accuracy in the context of broadly known biases. Second, we demonstrate how a foundation model trained without fairness constraints on observational health data can be leveraged to generate causally fair downstream predictions in tasks with known social and medical disparities. This work presents a model-agnostic pipeline for training causally fair machine learning models that address both direct and indirect forms of healthcare bias.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study tabular reinforcement learning problems with multiple steps of lookahead information. Before acting, the learner observes $\ell$ steps of future transition and reward realizations: the exact state the agent would reach and the rewards it would collect under any possible course of action. While it has been shown that such information can drastically boost the value, finding the optimal policy is NP-hard, and it is common to apply one of two tractable heuristics: processing the lookahead in chunks of predefined sizes ('fixed batching policies'), and model predictive control. We first illustrate the problems with these two approaches and propose utilizing the lookahead in adaptive (state-dependent) batches; we refer to such policies as adaptive batching policies (ABPs). We derive the optimal Bellman equations for these strategies and design an optimistic regret-minimizing algorithm that enables learning the optimal ABP when interacting with unknown environments. Our regret bounds are order-optimal up to a potential factor of the lookahead horizon $\ell$, which can usually be considered a small constant.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable advanced natural language processing but face deployment challenges on resource-constrained edge devices due to high computational, memory, and energy demands. Optimizing these models requires addressing three key challenges: acquiring task-specific data, fine-tuning for performance, and compressing models to accelerate inference while reducing resource demands. We propose an integrated framework combining GPTQ-based quantization, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), and a specialized data distillation process to significantly reduce model size and complexity while preserving or enhancing task-specific performance. By leveraging data distillation, knowledge distillation via Kullback-Leibler divergence, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and the Muon optimizer, our pipeline achieves up to 2x memory compression (e.g., reducing a 6GB model to 3GB) and enables efficient inference for specialized tasks. Empirical results demonstrate superior performance on standard LLM benchmarks compared to GPTQ quantization alone, with the Muon optimizer notably enhancing fine-tuned models' resistance to accuracy decay during quantization.

Abstract: Most language-based assistants follow a reactive ask-and-respond paradigm, requiring users to explicitly state their needs. As a result, relevant but unexpressed needs often go unmet. Existing proactive agents attempt to address this gap either by eliciting further clarification, preserving this burden, or by extrapolating future needs from context, often leading to unnecessary or mistimed interventions. We introduce ProPer, Proactivity-driven Personalized agents, a novel two-agent architecture consisting of a Dimension Generating Agent (DGA) and a Response Generating Agent (RGA). DGA, a fine-tuned LLM agent, leverages explicit user data to generate multiple implicit dimensions (latent aspects relevant to the user's task but not considered by the user) or knowledge gaps. These dimensions are selectively filtered using a reranker based on quality, diversity, and task relevance. RGA then balances explicit and implicit dimensions to tailor personalized responses with timely and proactive interventions. We evaluate ProPer across multiple domains using a structured, gap-aware rubric that measures coverage, initiative appropriateness, and intent alignment. Our results show that ProPer improves quality scores and win rates across all domains, achieving up to 84% gains in single-turn evaluation and consistent dominance in multi-turn interactions.

Abstract: Scaling laws have played a major role in the modern AI revolution, providing practitioners predictive power over how the model performance will improve with increasing data, compute, and number of model parameters. This has spurred an intense interest in the origin of neural scaling laws, with a common suggestion being that they arise from power law structure already present in the data. In this paper we study scaling laws for transformers trained to predict random walks (bigrams) on graphs with tunable complexity. We demonstrate that this simplified setting already gives rise to neural scaling laws even in the absence of power law structure in the data correlations. We further consider dialing down the complexity of natural language systematically, by training on sequences sampled from increasingly simplified generative language models, from 4,2,1-layer transformer language models down to language bigrams, revealing a monotonic evolution of the scaling exponents. Our results also include scaling laws obtained from training on random walks on random graphs drawn from Erdös-Renyi and scale-free Barabási-Albert ensembles. Finally, we revisit conventional scaling laws for language modeling, demonstrating that several essential results can be reproduced using 2 layer transformers with context length of 50, provide a critical analysis of various fits used in prior literature, demonstrate an alternative method for obtaining compute optimal curves as compared with current practice in published literature, and provide preliminary evidence that maximal update parameterization may be more parameter efficient than standard parameterization.

Abstract: Metric Differential Privacy (mDP) generalizes Local Differential Privacy (LDP) by adapting privacy guarantees based on pairwise distances, enabling context-aware protection and improved utility. While existing optimization-based methods reduce utility loss effectively in coarse-grained domains, optimizing mDP in fine-grained or continuous settings remains challenging due to the computational cost of constructing dense perterubation matrices and satisfying pointwise constraints.
  In this paper, we propose an interpolation-based framework for optimizing lp-norm mDP in such domains. Our approach optimizes perturbation distributions at a sparse set of anchor points and interpolates distributions at non-anchor locations via log-convex combinations, which provably preserve mDP. To address privacy violations caused by naive interpolation in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design. We further explore joint optimization over perturbation distributions and privacy budget allocation across dimensions. Experiments on real-world location datasets demonstrate that our method offers rigorous privacy guarantees and competitive utility in fine-grained domains, outperforming baseline mechanisms. in high-dimensional spaces, we decompose the interpolation process into a sequence of one-dimensional steps and derive a corrected formulation that enforces lp-norm mDP by design.

Abstract: Transformers are designed for discrete tokens, yet many real-world signals are continuous processes observed through noisy sampling. Discrete tokenizations (raw values, patches, finite differences) can be brittle in low signal-to-noise regimes, especially when downstream objectives impose asymmetric penalties that rationally encourage abstention. We introduce Kinematic Tokenization, an optimization-based continuous-time representation that reconstructs an explicit spline from noisy measurements and tokenizes local spline coefficients (position, velocity, acceleration, jerk). This is applied to financial time series data in the form of asset prices in conjunction with trading volume profiles. Across a multi-asset daily-equity testbed, we use a risk-averse asymmetric classification objective as a stress test for learnability. Under this objective, several discrete baselines collapse to an absorbing cash policy (the Liquidation Equilibrium), whereas the continuous spline tokens sustain calibrated, non-trivial action distributions and stable policies. These results suggest that explicit continuous-time tokens can improve the learnability and calibration of selective decision policies in noisy time series under abstention-inducing losses.

Abstract: We consider a single large language model (LLM) server that serves a heterogeneous stream of queries belonging to $N$ distinct task types. Queries arrive according to a Poisson process, and each type occurs with a known prior probability. For each task type, the server allocates a fixed number of internal thinking tokens, which determines the computational effort devoted to that query. The token allocation induces an accuracy-latency trade-off: the service time follows an approximately affine function of the allocated tokens, while the probability of a correct response exhibits diminishing returns. Under a first-in, first-out (FIFO) service discipline, the system operates as an $M/G/1$ queue, and the mean system time depends on the first and second moments of the resulting service-time distribution. We formulate a constrained optimization problem that maximizes a weighted average accuracy objective penalized by the mean system time, subject to architectural token-budget constraints and queue-stability conditions. The objective function is shown to be strictly concave over the stability region, which ensures existence and uniqueness of the optimal token allocation. The first-order optimality conditions yield a coupled projected fixed-point characterization of the optimum, together with an iterative solution and an explicit sufficient condition for contraction. Moreover, a projected gradient method with a computable global step-size bound is developed to guarantee convergence beyond the contractive regime. Finally, integer-valued token allocations are attained via rounding of the continuous solution, and the resulting performance loss is evaluated in simulation results.

Abstract: We argue that the machine learning value chain is structurally unsustainable due to an economic data processing inequality: each state in the data cycle from inputs to model weights to synthetic outputs refines technical signal but strips economic equity from data generators. We show, by analyzing seventy-three public data deals, that the majority of value accrues to aggregators, with documented creator royalties rounding to zero and widespread opacity of deal terms. This is not just an economic welfare concern: as data and its derivatives become economic assets, the feedback loop that sustains current learning algorithms is at risk. We identify three structural faults - missing provenance, asymmetric bargaining power, and non-dynamic pricing - as the operational machinery of this inequality. In our analysis, we trace these problems along the machine learning value chain and propose an Equitable Data-Value Exchange (EDVEX) Framework to enable a minimal market that benefits all participants. Finally, we outline research directions where our community can make concrete contributions to data deals and contextualize our position with related and orthogonal viewpoints.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization augmented machine learning (COAML) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for integrating predictive models with combinatorial decision-making. By embedding combinatorial optimization oracles into learning pipelines, COAML enables the construction of policies that are both data-driven and feasibility-preserving, bridging the traditions of machine learning, operations research, and stochastic optimization. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in COAML. We introduce a unifying framework for COAML pipelines, describe their methodological building blocks, and formalize their connection to empirical cost minimization. We then develop a taxonomy of problem settings based on the form of uncertainty and decision structure. Using this taxonomy, we review algorithmic approaches for static and dynamic problems, survey applications across domains such as scheduling, vehicle routing, stochastic programming, and reinforcement learning, and synthesize methodological contributions in terms of empirical cost minimization, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning. Finally, we identify key research frontiers.

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is a core machine learning problem with broad applications. Recently there has been growing interest in repurposing large language models (LLMs) for TSC, motivated by their strong reasoning and generalization ability. Prior work has primarily focused on alignment strategies that explicitly map time series data into the textual domain; however, the choice of time series encoder architecture remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study of hybrid architectures that combine specialized time series encoders with a frozen LLM backbone. We evaluate a diverse set of encoder families, including Inception, convolutional, residual, transformer-based, and multilayer perceptron architectures, among which the Inception model is the only encoder architecture that consistently yields positive performance gains when integrated with an LLM backbone. Overall, this study highlights the impact of time series encoder choice in hybrid LLM architectures and points to Inception-based models as a promising direction for future LLM-driven time series learning.

Abstract: We introduce \emph{in-context operator learning on probability measure spaces} for optimal transport (OT). The goal is to learn a single solution operator that maps a pair of distributions to the OT map, using only few-shot samples from each distribution as a prompt and \emph{without} gradient updates at inference. We parameterize the solution operator and develop scaling-law theory in two regimes. In the \emph{nonparametric} setting, when tasks concentrate on a low-intrinsic-dimension manifold of source--target pairs, we establish generalization bounds that quantify how in-context accuracy scales with prompt size, intrinsic task dimension, and model capacity. In the \emph{parametric} setting (e.g., Gaussian families), we give an explicit architecture that recovers the exact OT map in context and provide finite-sample excess-risk bounds. Our numerical experiments on synthetic transports and generative-modeling benchmarks validate the framework.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a key technique in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), enabling rapid identification of the most relevant high-dimensional embeddings from massive vector databases. Modern ANNS engines accelerate this process using prebuilt indexes and store compressed vector-quantized representations in fast memory. However, they still rely on a costly second-pass refinement stage that reads full-precision vectors from slower storage like SSDs. For modern text and multimodal embeddings, these reads now dominate the latency of the entire query. We propose FaTRQ, a far-memory-aware refinement system using tiered memory that eliminates the need to fetch full vectors from storage. It introduces a progressive distance estimator that refines coarse scores using compact residuals streamed from far memory. Refinement stops early once a candidate is provably outside the top-k. To support this, we propose tiered residual quantization, which encodes residuals as ternary values stored efficiently in far memory. A custom accelerator is deployed in a CXL Type-2 device to perform low-latency refinement locally. Together, FaTRQ improves the storage efficiency by 2.4$\times$ and improves the throughput by up to 9$ \times$ than SOTA GPU ANNS system.

Abstract: We present a hybrid transformer architecture that replaces discrete middle layers with a continuous-depth Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) block, enabling inference-time control over generation attributes via a learned steering signal. Unlike standard transformers that process representations through fixed discrete layers, our approach treats depth as a continuous variable governed by a learned vector field $F_θ(H, τ, u)$, where $u$ is a low-dimensional control signal injected via explicit concatenation. We validate the architecture through four experiments: (1) gradient flow stability with zero exploding/vanishing gradient events, (2) semantic steering achieving 98\%/88\% accuracy for positive/negative sentiment control, (3) continuous interpolation validated by a negligible 0.068\% trajectory divergence between fixed and adaptive solvers, and (4) efficiency benchmarking demonstrating latency parity with standard discrete baselines. Additionally, we show that adaptive ODE solvers reveal geometric structure in the learned dynamics: the control signal partitions the vector field into distinct dynamical regimes with different curvature characteristics. The adjoint method enables $O(1)$ memory training regardless of integration depth. Our results demonstrate that continuous-depth dynamics with learned control signals provide a viable, efficient mechanism for steerable language generation.

Abstract: Multimodal decentralized federated learning (DFL) is challenging because agents differ in available modalities and model architectures, yet must collaborate over peer-to-peer (P2P) networks without a central coordinator. Standard multimodal pipelines learn a single shared embedding across all modalities. In DFL, such a monolithic representation induces gradient misalignment between uni- and multimodal agents; as a result, it suppresses heterogeneous sharing and cross-modal interaction. We present PARSE, a multimodal DFL framework that operationalizes partial information decomposition (PID) in a server-free setting. Each agent performs feature fission to factorize its latent representation into redundant, unique, and synergistic slices. P2P knowledge sharing among heterogeneous agents is enabled by slice-level partial alignment: only semantically shareable branches are exchanged among agents that possess the corresponding modality. By removing the need for central coordination and gradient surgery, PARSE resolves uni-/multimodal gradient conflicts, thereby overcoming the multimodal DFL dilemma while remaining compatible with standard DFL constraints. Across benchmarks and agent mixes, PARSE yields consistent gains over task-, modality-, and hybrid-sharing DFL baselines. Ablations on fusion operators and split ratios, together with qualitative visualizations, further demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed design.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) enables collaboratively model training on decentralized, heterogeneous data while tailoring them to each client's unique distribution. However, existing PFL methods produce static models with a fixed tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, limiting their applicability in environments where inference requirements vary with contexts and resource availability. Early-exit networks (EENs) offer adaptive inference by attaching intermediate classifiers. Yet integrating them into PFL is challenging due to client-wise heterogeneity and depth-wise interference arising from conflicting exit objectives. Prior studies fail to resolve both conflicts simultaneously, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose CAFEDistill, a Conflict-Aware Federated Exit Distillation framework that jointly addresses these conflicts and extends PFL to early-exit networks. Through a progressive, depth-prioritized student coordination mechanism, CAFEDistill mitigates interference among shallow and deep exits while allowing effective personalized knowledge transfer across clients. Furthermore, it reduces communication overhead via a client-decoupled formulation. Extensive evaluations show that CAFEDistill outperforms the state-of-the-arts, achieving higher accuracy and reducing inference costs by 30.79%-46.86%.

Abstract: This paper studies time aggregation features for XGBoost models in click-through rate prediction. The setting is the Avazu click-through rate prediction dataset with strict out-of-time splits and a no-lookahead feature constraint. Features for hour H use only impressions from hours strictly before H. This paper compares a strong time-aware target encoding baseline to models augmented with entity history time aggregation under several window designs. Across two rolling-tail folds on a deterministic ten percent sample, a trailing window specification improves ROC AUC by about 0.0066 to 0.0082 and PR AUC by about 0.0084 to 0.0094 relative to target encoding alone. Within the time aggregation design grid, event count windows provide the only consistent improvement over trailing windows, and the gain is small. Gap windows and bucketized windows underperform simple trailing windows in this dataset and protocol. These results support a practical default of trailing windows, with an optional event count window when marginal ROC AUC gains matter.

Abstract: Ensemble learning is widely recognized as a pivotal strategy for pushing the boundaries of predictive performance. Traditional static ensemble methods, such as Stacking, typically assign weights by treating each base learner as a holistic entity, thereby overlooking the fact that individual models exhibit varying degrees of competence across different regions of the instance space. To address this limitation, Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) was introduced. However, both static and dynamic approaches predominantly rely on the divergence among different models as the basis for integration. This inter-model perspective neglects the intrinsic characteristics of the models themselves and necessitates a heavy reliance on validation sets for competence estimation. In this paper, we propose the Behavioral Profiling Ensemble (BPE) framework, which introduces a novel paradigm shift. Unlike traditional methods, BPE constructs a ``behavioral profile'' intrinsic to each model and derives integration weights based on the deviation between the model's response to a specific test instance and its established behavioral profile. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the algorithm derived from the BPE framework achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art ensemble baselines. These gains are evident not only in predictive accuracy but also in computational efficiency and storage resource utilization across various scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, yet the quality of their predictions is fundamentally limited by the few costly labeled demonstrations that can fit into a prompt. Meanwhile, there exist vast and continuously growing amounts of unlabeled data that may be closely related to the ICL task. How to utilize such unlabeled data to provably enhance the performance of ICL thus becomes an emerging fundamental question. In this work, we propose a novel augmented ICL framework, in which the prompt includes a small set of labeled examples alongside a block of unlabeled inputs. We focus on the multi-class linear classification setting and demonstrate that, with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, a multi-layer transformer can effectively emulate an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This enables the transformer to implicitly extract useful information from both labeled and unlabeled data, leading to provable improvements in ICL accuracy. Moreover, we show that such a transformer can be trained via teacher forcing, with its parameters converging to the desired solution at a linear rate. Experiments demonstrate that the augmented ICL framework consistently outperforms conventional few-shot ICL, providing empirical support for our theoretical findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study on the impact of unlabeled data on the ICL performance of transformers.

Abstract: Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is the dominant paradigm for private training, but its fundamental limitations under worst-case adversarial privacy definitions remain poorly understood. We analyze DP-SGD in the $f$-differential privacy framework, which characterizes privacy via hypothesis-testing trade-off curves, and study shuffled sampling over a single epoch with $M$ gradient updates. We derive an explicit suboptimal upper bound on the achievable trade-off curve. This result induces a geometric lower bound on the separation $κ$ which is the maximum distance between the mechanism's trade-off curve and the ideal random-guessing line. Because a large separation implies significant adversarial advantage, meaningful privacy requires small $κ$. However, we prove that enforcing a small separation imposes a strict lower bound on the Gaussian noise multiplier $σ$, which directly limits the achievable utility. In particular, under the standard worst-case adversarial model, shuffled DP-SGD must satisfy
  $σ\ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\ln M}}$ $\quad\text{or}\quad$ $κ\ge\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{8}}\!\left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{4π\ln M}}\right)$,
  and thus cannot simultaneously achieve strong privacy and high utility. Although this bound vanishes asymptotically as $M \to \infty$, the convergence is extremely slow: even for practically relevant numbers of updates the required noise magnitude remains substantial. We further show that the same limitation extends to Poisson subsampling up to constant factors. Our experiments confirm that the noise levels implied by this bound leads to significant accuracy degradation at realistic training settings, thus showing a critical bottleneck in DP-SGD under standard worst-case adversarial assumptions.

Abstract: Content-based recommendation systems (CRSs) utilize content features to predict user-item interactions, serving as essential tools for helping users navigate information-rich web services. However, ensuring the effectiveness of CRSs requires large-scale and even continuous model training to accommodate diverse user preferences, resulting in significant computational costs and resource demands. A promising approach to this challenge is coreset selection, which identifies a small but representative subset of data samples that preserves model quality while reducing training overhead. Yet, the selected coreset is vulnerable to the pervasive noise in user-item interactions, particularly when it is minimally sized. To this end, we propose Noise-aware Coreset Selection (NaCS), a specialized framework for CRSs. NaCS constructs coresets through submodular optimization based on training gradients, while simultaneously correcting noisy labels using a progressively trained model. Meanwhile, we refine the selected coreset by filtering out low-confidence samples through uncertainty quantification, thereby avoid training with unreliable interactions. Through extensive experiments, we show that NaCS produces higher-quality coresets for CRSs while achieving better efficiency than existing coreset selection techniques. Notably, NaCS recovers 93-95\% of full-dataset training performance using merely 1\% of the training data.

Abstract: Assessment of sperm morphological quality remains a critical yet subjective component of male fertility evaluation, often limited by inter-observer variability and resource constraints. This study presents a comparative biomedical artificial intelligence framework evaluating an image-based deep learning model (HuSHeM) alongside a clinically grounded baseline derived from World Health Organization criteria augmented with the Systemic Inflammation Response Index (WHO(+SIRI)).
  The HuSHeM model was trained on high-resolution sperm morphology images and evaluated using an independent clinical cohort. Model performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility analyses. The HuSHeM model demonstrated higher discriminative performance, as reflected by an increased area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with relatively narrow confidence intervals compared to WHO(+SIRI). Precision-recall analysis further indicated improved performance under class imbalance, with higher precision-recall area values across evaluated thresholds. Calibration analysis indicated closer agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes for HuSHeM, while decision curve analysis suggested greater net clinical benefit across clinically relevant threshold probabilities.
  These findings suggest that image-based deep learning may offer improved predictive reliability and clinical utility compared with traditional rule-based and inflammation-augmented criteria. The proposed framework supports objective and reproducible assessment of sperm morphology and may serve as a decision-support tool within fertility screening and referral workflows. The proposed models are intended as decision-support or referral tools and are not designed to replace clinical judgment or laboratory assessment.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become essential for eliciting complex reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the substantial memory overhead of storing Key-Value (KV) caches during long-horizon rollouts acts as a critical bottleneck, often prohibiting efficient training on limited hardware. While existing KV compression techniques offer a remedy for inference, directly applying them to RL training induces a severe policy mismatch, leading to catastrophic performance collapse. To address this, we introduce Sparse-RL empowers stable RL training under sparse rollouts. We show that instability arises from a fundamental policy mismatch among the dense old policy, the sparse sampler policy, and the learner policy. To mitigate this issue, Sparse-RL incorporates Sparsity-Aware Rejection Sampling and Importance-based Reweighting to correct the off-policy bias introduced by compression-induced information loss. Experimental results show that Sparse-RL reduces rollout overhead compared to dense baselines while preserving the performance. Furthermore, Sparse-RL inherently implements sparsity-aware training, significantly enhancing model robustness during sparse inference deployment.

Abstract: Machine learning classification systems are susceptible to poor performance when trained with incorrect ground truth labels, even when data is well-curated by expert annotators. As machine learning becomes more widespread, it is increasingly imperative to identify and correct mislabeling to develop more powerful models. In this work, we motivate and describe Adaptive Label Error Detection (ALED), a novel method of detecting mislabeling. ALED extracts an intermediate feature space from a deep convolutional neural network, denoises the features, models the reduced manifold of each class with a multidimensional Gaussian distribution, and performs a simple likelihood ratio test to identify mislabeled samples. We show that ALED has markedly increased sensitivity, without compromising precision, compared to established label error detection methods, on multiple medical imaging datasets. We demonstrate an example where fine-tuning a neural network on corrected data results in a 33.8% decrease in test set errors, providing strong benefits to end users. The ALED detector is deployed in the Python package statlab.

Abstract: The meta-analysis's utility is dependent on previous studies having accurately captured the variables of interest, but in medical studies, a key decision variable that impacts a physician's decisions was not captured. This results in an unknown effect size and unreliable conclusions. A Bayesian approach may allow analysis to determine if the claim of a positive effect is still warranted, and we build a Bayesian approach to this common medical scenario. To demonstrate its utility, we assist professional OBGYNs in evaluating Trial of Labor After a Cesarean-section (TOLAC) situations where few interventions are available for patients and find the support needed for physicians to advance patient care.

Abstract: Multimodal clinical prediction is widely used to integrate heterogeneous data such as Electronic Health Records (EHR) and biosignals. However, existing methods tend to rely on static modality integration schemes and simple fusion strategies. As a result, they fail to fully exploit modality-specific representations. In this paper, we propose Level-guided Modal Fusion (LeMoF), a novel framework that selectively integrates level-guided representations within each modality. Each level refers to a representation extracted from a different layer of the encoder. LeMoF explicitly separates and learns global modality-level predictions from level-specific discriminative representations. This design enables LeMoF to achieve a balanced performance between prediction stability and discriminative capability even in heterogeneous clinical environments. Experiments on length of stay prediction using Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data demonstrate that LeMoF consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal fusion techniques across various encoder configurations. We also confirmed that level-wise integration is a key factor in achieving robust predictive performance across various clinical conditions.

Abstract: Multimodal models excel in English, supported by abundant image-text and audio-text data, but performance drops sharply for other languages due to limited multilingual multimodal resources. Existing solutions rely heavily on machine translation, while advances in multilingual text modeling remain underutilized. We introduce METAL, a lightweight alignment method that learns only a few linear layers using English text alone to map multilingual text embeddings into a multimodal space. Despite its simplicity, METAL matches baseline performance in English (94.9 percent Recall at 10) and achieves strong zero-shot transfer (89.5 percent Recall at 10 averaged across 11 languages, 10 unseen) on XTD text-to-image retrieval. Qualitative t-SNE visualizations show that multilingual embeddings align tightly with multimodal representations, while weight analysis reveals that the transformation reshapes embedding geometry rather than performing trivial rotations. Beyond image-text retrieval, METAL generalizes to audio-text retrieval and cross-lingual text-to-image generation. We release code and checkpoints at https://github.com/m2m-codebase/M2M , as well as multilingual evaluation datasets including MSCOCO Multilingual 30K (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/mscoco-multilingual-30k ), AudioCaps Multilingual (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/audiocaps-multilingual ), and Clotho Multilingual (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/clotho-multilingual ), to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an essential and pervasive functionality for applying large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. However, it has the potential to substantially degrade safety alignment, e.g., by greatly increasing susceptibility to jailbreak attacks, even when the fine-tuning data is entirely harmless. Despite garnering growing attention in defense efforts during the fine-tuning stage, existing methods struggle with a persistent safety-utility dilemma: emphasizing safety compromises task performance, whereas prioritizing utility typically requires deep fine-tuning that inevitably leads to steep safety declination.
  In this work, we address this dilemma by shedding new light on the geometric interaction between safety- and utility-oriented gradients in safety-aligned LLMs. Through systematic empirical analysis, we uncover three key insights: (I) safety gradients lie in a low-rank subspace, while utility gradients span a broader high-dimensional space; (II) these subspaces are often negatively correlated, causing directional conflicts during fine-tuning; and (III) the dominant safety direction can be efficiently estimated from a single sample. Building upon these novel insights, we propose safety-preserving fine-tuning (SPF), a lightweight approach that explicitly removes gradient components conflicting with the low-rank safety subspace. Theoretically, we show that SPF guarantees utility convergence while bounding safety drift. Empirically, SPF consistently maintains downstream task performance and recovers nearly all pre-trained safety alignment, even under adversarial fine-tuning scenarios. Furthermore, SPF exhibits robust resistance to both deep fine-tuning and dynamic jailbreak attacks. Together, our findings provide new mechanistic understanding and practical guidance toward always-aligned LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: The effectiveness of contrastive learning methods has been widely recognized in the field of graph learning, especially in contexts where graph data often lack labels or are difficult to label. However, the application of these methods to node classification tasks still faces a number of challenges. First, existing data enhancement techniques may lead to significant differences from the original view when generating new views, which may weaken the relevance of the view and affect the efficiency of model training. Second, the vast majority of existing graph comparison learning algorithms rely on the use of a large number of negative samples. To address the above challenges, this study proposes a novel node classification contrast learning method called Simple Network Graph Comparative Learning (SNGCL). Specifically, SNGCL employs a superimposed multilayer Laplace smoothing filter as a step in processing the data to obtain global and local feature smoothing matrices, respectively, which are thus passed into the target and online networks of the siamese network, and finally employs an improved triple recombination loss function to bring the intra-class distance closer and the inter-class distance farther. We have compared SNGCL with state-of-the-art models in node classification tasks, and the experimental results show that SNGCL is strongly competitive in most tasks.

Abstract: Compressing the KV cache is a required step to deploy large language models on edge devices. Current quantization methods compress storage but fail to reduce bandwidth as attention calculation requires dequantizing keys from INT4/INT8 to FP16 before use. We observe that attention scoring is mathematically equivalent to the inner product similarity search and we can apply some compression techniques from vector databases to compress KV-cache better. We propose LOOKAT, which applies product quantization and asymmetric distance computation, to transformer architecture by decomposing key vectors into subspaces, learning codebooks and computing attention tables via lookup tables. This transforms attention from memory-bound to compute-bound. LOOKAT achieves 64 $\times$ compression at 95.7\% output fidelity and 32 $\times$ compression at 95.0\% fidelity when tested on GPT-2. LOOKAT requires no architecture changes or training while maintaining rank correlation $ρ> 0.95$. Theoretical analysis confirms that rank correlation degrades as $O(d_k/mK)$, with guarantees validated across sequence lengths up to 1024 tokens.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) prediction, a central problem in modern marketing, is characterized by a unique zero-inflated and long-tail data distribution. This distribution presents two fundamental challenges: (1) the vast majority of low-to-medium value users numerically overwhelm the small but critically important segment of high-value "whale" users, and (2) significant value heterogeneity exists even within the low-to-medium value user base. Common approaches either rely on rigid statistical assumptions or attempt to decouple ranking and regression using ordered buckets; however, they often enforce ordinality through loss-based constraints rather than inherent architectural design, failing to balance global accuracy with high-value precision. To address this gap, we propose \textbf{C}onditional \textbf{C}ascaded \textbf{O}rdinal-\textbf{R}esidual Networks \textbf{(CC-OR-Net)}, a novel unified framework that achieves a more robust decoupling through \textbf{structural decomposition}, where ranking is architecturally guaranteed. CC-OR-Net integrates three specialized components: a \textit{structural ordinal decomposition module} for robust ranking, an \textit{intra-bucket residual module} for fine-grained regression, and a \textit{targeted high-value augmentation module} for precision on top-tier users. Evaluated on real-world datasets with over 300M users, CC-OR-Net achieves a superior trade-off across all key business metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in creating a holistic and commercially valuable LTV prediction solution.

Abstract: Pre-trained models operating directly on raw bytes have achieved promising performance in encrypted network traffic classification (NTC), but often suffer from shortcut learning-relying on spurious correlations that fail to generalize to real-world data. Existing solutions heavily rely on model-specific interpretation techniques, which lack adaptability and generality across different model architectures and deployment scenarios.
  In this paper, we propose BiasSeeker, the first semi-automated framework that is both model-agnostic and data-driven for detecting dataset-specific shortcut features in encrypted traffic. By performing statistical correlation analysis directly on raw binary traffic, BiasSeeker identifies spurious or environment-entangled features that may compromise generalization, independent of any classifier. To address the diverse nature of shortcut features, we introduce a systematic categorization and apply category-specific validation strategies that reduce bias while preserving meaningful information.
  We evaluate BiasSeeker on 19 public datasets across three NTC tasks. By emphasizing context-aware feature selection and dataset-specific diagnosis, BiasSeeker offers a novel perspective for understanding and addressing shortcut learning in encrypted network traffic classification, raising awareness that feature selection should be an intentional and scenario-sensitive step prior to model training.

Abstract: Climate prediction is a challenge due to the intricate spatiotemporal patterns within Earth systems. Global climate indices, such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for long-term rainfall prediction. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel NorthEast monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas. This approach effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.

Abstract: High-dimensional data often exhibit dependencies among variables that violate the isotropic-noise assumption under which principal component analysis (PCA) is optimal. For cases where the noise is not independent and identically distributed across features (i.e., the covariance is not spherical) we introduce Graph Regularized PCA (GR-PCA). It is a graph-based regularization of PCA that incorporates the dependency structure of the data features by learning a sparse precision graph and biasing loadings toward the low-frequency Fourier modes of the corresponding graph Laplacian. Consequently, high-frequency signals are suppressed, while graph-coherent low-frequency ones are preserved, yielding interpretable principal components aligned with conditional relationships. We evaluate GR-PCA on synthetic data spanning diverse graph topologies, signal-to-noise ratios, and sparsity levels. Compared to mainstream alternatives, it concentrates variance on the intended support, produces loadings with lower graph-Laplacian energy, and remains competitive in out-of-sample reconstruction. When high-frequency signals are present, the graph Laplacian penalty prevents overfitting, reducing the reconstruction accuracy but improving structural fidelity. The advantage over PCA is most pronounced when high-frequency signals are graph-correlated, whereas PCA remains competitive when such signals are nearly rotationally invariant. The procedure is simple to implement, modular with respect to the precision estimator, and scalable, providing a practical route to structure-aware dimensionality reduction that improves structural fidelity without sacrificing predictive performance.

Abstract: Improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a continuous topic recently. But most relevant works are based on outcome rewards at the trajectory level, missing fine-grained supervision during the reasoning process. Other existing training frameworks that try to combine process signals together to optimize LLMs also rely heavily on tedious additional steps like MCTS, training a separate reward model, etc., doing harm to the training efficiency. Moreover, the intuition behind the process signals design lacks rigorous theoretical support, leaving the understanding of the optimization mechanism opaque. In this paper, we propose Process Reward Learning (PRL), which decomposes the entropy regularized reinforcement learning objective into intermediate steps, with rigorous process rewards that could be assigned to models accordingly. Starting from theoretical motivation, we derive the formulation of PRL that is essentially equivalent to the objective of reward maximization plus a KL-divergence penalty term between the policy model and a reference model. However, PRL could turn the outcome reward into process supervision signals, which helps better guide the exploration during RL optimization. From our experiment results, we demonstrate that PRL not only improves the average performance for LLMs' reasoning ability measured by average @ n, but also broadens the reasoning boundary by improving the pass @ n metric. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PRL could be verified and generalized.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) aims to improve generalization by minimizing a worst-case perturbed loss over a small neighborhood of model parameters. However, during training, its optimization behavior does not always align with theoretical expectations, since both sharp and flat regions may yield a small perturbed loss. In such cases, the gradient may still point toward sharp regions, failing to achieve the intended effect of SAM. To address this issue, we investigate SAM from a spectral and geometric perspective: specifically, we utilize the angle between the gradient and the leading eigenvector of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness. Our analysis illustrates that when this angle is less than or equal to ninety degrees, the effect of SAM's sharpness regularization can be weakened. Furthermore, we propose an explicit eigenvector-aligned SAM (X-SAM), which corrects the gradient via orthogonal decomposition along the top eigenvector, enabling more direct and efficient regularization of the Hessian's maximum eigenvalue. We prove X-SAM's convergence and superior generalization, with extensive experimental evaluations confirming both theoretical and practical advantages.

Abstract: This paper introduces an unsupervised health-monitoring framework for turbofan engines that does not require run-to-failure labels. First, operating-condition effects in NASA CMAPSS sensor streams are removed via regression-based normalisation; then a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder is trained only on the healthy portion of each trajectory. Persistent reconstruction error, estimated using an adaptive data-driven threshold, triggers real-time alerts without hand-tuned rules. Benchmark results show high recall and low false-alarm rates across multiple operating regimes, demonstrating that the method can be deployed quickly, scale to diverse fleets, and serve as a complementary early-warning layer to Remaining Useful Life models.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) provide a mesh-free approach for solving differential equations by embedding physical constraints into neural network training. However, PINNs tend to overfit within the training domain, leading to poor generalization when extrapolating beyond trained spatiotemporal regions. This work presents SPIKE (Sparse Physics-Informed Koopman-Enhanced), a framework that regularizes PINNs with continuous-time Koopman operators to learn parsimonious dynamics representations. By enforcing linear dynamics $dz/dt = Az$ in a learned observable space, both PIKE (without explicit sparsity) and SPIKE (with L1 regularization on $A$) learn sparse generator matrices, embodying the parsimony principle that complex dynamics admit low-dimensional structure. Experiments across parabolic, hyperbolic, dispersive, and stiff PDEs, including fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes) and chaotic ODEs (Lorenz), demonstrate consistent improvements in temporal extrapolation, spatial generalization, and long-term prediction accuracy. The continuous-time formulation with matrix exponential integration provides unconditional stability for stiff systems while avoiding diagonal dominance issues inherent in discrete-time Koopman operators.

Abstract: The World Wide Web thrives on intelligent services that rely on accurate time series classification, which has recently witnessed significant progress driven by advances in deep learning. However, existing studies face challenges in domain incremental learning. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and robust dual-causal disentanglement framework (DualCD) to enhance the robustness of models under domain incremental scenarios, which can be seamlessly integrated into time series classification models. Specifically, DualCD first introduces a temporal feature disentanglement module to capture class-causal features and spurious features. The causal features can offer sufficient predictive power to support the classifier in domain incremental learning settings. To accurately capture these causal features, we further design a dual-causal intervention mechanism to eliminate the influence of both intra-class and inter-class confounding features. This mechanism constructs variant samples by combining the current class's causal features with intra-class spurious features and with causal features from other classes. The causal intervention loss encourages the model to accurately predict the labels of these variant samples based solely on the causal features. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate that DualCD effectively improves performance in domain incremental scenarios. We summarize our rich experiments into a comprehensive benchmark to facilitate research in domain incremental time series classification.

Abstract: Traffic flow prediction is a typical spatio-temporal prediction problem and has a wide range of applications. The core challenge lies in modeling the underlying complex spatio-temporal dependencies. Various methods have been proposed, and recent studies show that the modeling of dynamics is useful to meet the core challenge. While handling spatial dependencies and temporal dependencies using separate base model structures may hinder the modeling of spatio-temporal correlations, the modeling of dynamics can bridge this gap. Incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity also advances the main goal, since it can extend the parameter space and allow more flexibility. Despite these advances, two limitations persist: 1) the modeling of dynamics is often limited to the dynamics of spatial topology (e.g., adjacency matrix changes), which, however, can be extended to a broader scope; 2) the modeling of heterogeneity is often separated for spatial and temporal dimensions, but this gap can also be bridged by the modeling of dynamics. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for traffic prediction, called Meta Dynamic Graph (MetaDG). MetaDG leverages dynamic graph structures of node representations to explicitly model spatio-temporal dynamics. This generates both dynamic adjacency matrices and meta-parameters, extending dynamic modeling beyond topology while unifying the capture of spatio-temporal heterogeneity into a single dimension. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of MetaDG.

Abstract: We propose Strategy-aware Surprise (SuS), a novel intrinsic motivation framework that uses pre-post prediction mismatch as a novelty signal for exploration in reinforcement learning. Unlike traditional curiosity-driven methods that rely solely on state prediction error, SuS introduces two complementary components: Strategy Stability (SS) and Strategy Surprise (SuS). SS measures consistency in behavioral strategy across temporal steps, while SuS captures unexpected outcomes relative to the agent's current strategy representation. Our combined reward formulation leverages both signals through learned weighting coefficients. We evaluate SuS on mathematical reasoning tasks using large language models, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and solution diversity. Ablation studies confirm that removing either component results in at least 10% performance degradation, validating the synergistic nature of our approach. SuS achieves 17.4% improvement in Pass@1 and 26.4% improvement in Pass@5 compared to baseline methods, while maintaining higher strategy diversity throughout training.

Abstract: Wearable devices enable continuous, population-scale monitoring of physiological signals, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), creating new opportunities for data-driven clinical assessment. Time-series extrinsic regression (TSER) models increasingly leverage PPG signals to estimate clinically relevant outcomes, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. For clinical reasoning and trust, however, single point estimates alone are insufficient: clinicians must also understand whether predictions are stable under physiologically plausible variations and to what extent realistic, attainable changes in physiological signals would meaningfully alter a model's prediction. Counterfactual explanations (CFE) address these "what-if" questions, yet existing time series CFE generation methods are largely restricted to classification, overlook waveform morphology, and often produce physiologically implausible signals, limiting their applicability to continuous biomedical time series. To address these limitations, we introduce EvoMorph, a multi-objective evolutionary framework for generating physiologically plausible and diverse CFE for TSER applications. EvoMorph optimizes morphology-aware objectives defined on interpretable signal descriptors and applies transformations to preserve the waveform structure. We evaluated EvoMorph on three PPG datasets (heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation) against a nearest-unlike-neighbor baseline. In addition, in a case study, we evaluated EvoMorph as a tool for uncertainty quantification by relating counterfactual sensitivity to bootstrap-ensemble uncertainty and data-density measures. Overall, EvoMorph enables the generation of physiologically-aware counterfactuals for continuous biomedical signals and supports uncertainty-aware interpretability, advancing trustworthy model analysis for clinical time-series applications.

Abstract: Large graph datasets make training graph neural networks (GNNs) computationally costly. Graph condensation methods address this by generating small synthetic graphs that approximate the original data. However, existing approaches rely on clean, supervised labels, which limits their reliability when labels are scarce, noisy, or inconsistent. We propose Pseudo-Labeled Graph Condensation (PLGC), a self-supervised framework that constructs latent pseudo-labels from node embeddings and optimizes condensed graphs to match the original graph's structural and feature statistics -- without requiring ground-truth labels. PLGC offers three key contributions: (1) A diagnosis of why supervised condensation fails under label noise and distribution shift. (2) A label-free condensation method that jointly learns latent prototypes and node assignments. (3) Theoretical guarantees showing that pseudo-labels preserve latent structural statistics of the original graph and ensure accurate embedding alignment. Empirically, across node classification and link prediction tasks, PLGC achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art supervised condensation methods on clean datasets and exhibits substantial robustness under label noise, often outperforming all baselines by a significant margin. Our findings highlight the practical and theoretical advantages of self-supervised graph condensation in noisy or weakly-labeled environments.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables policy optimization from static datasets but is inherently vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing attack strategies typically struggle against safety-constrained algorithms (e.g., CQL) due to inefficient random poisoning and the use of easily detectable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) triggers. In this paper, we propose CS-GBA (Critical Sample-based Gradient-guided Backdoor Attack), a novel framework designed to achieve high stealthiness and destructiveness under a strict budget. Leveraging the theoretical insight that samples with high Temporal Difference (TD) errors are pivotal for value function convergence, we introduce an adaptive Critical Sample Selection strategy that concentrates the attack budget on the most influential transitions. To evade OOD detection, we propose a Correlation-Breaking Trigger mechanism that exploits the physical mutual exclusivity of state features (e.g., 95th percentile boundaries) to remain statistically concealed. Furthermore, we replace the conventional label inversion with a Gradient-Guided Action Generation mechanism, which searches for worst-case actions within the data manifold using the victim Q-network's gradient. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving high attack success rates against representative safety-constrained algorithms with a minimal 5% poisoning budget, while maintaining the agent's performance in clean environments.

Abstract: We present DeFlow, a decoupled offline RL framework that leverages flow matching to faithfully capture complex behavior manifolds. Optimizing generative policies is computationally prohibitive, typically necessitating backpropagation through ODE solvers. We address this by learning a lightweight refinement module within an explicit, data-derived trust region of the flow manifold, rather than sacrificing the iterative generation capability via single-step distillation. This way, we bypass solver differentiation and eliminate the need for balancing loss terms, ensuring stable improvement while fully preserving the flow's iterative expressivity. Empirically, DeFlow achieves superior performance on the challenging OGBench benchmark and demonstrates efficient offline-to-online adaptation.

Abstract: Communication overhead is a critical challenge in federated learning, particularly in bandwidth-constrained networks. Although many methods have been proposed to reduce communication overhead, most focus solely on compressing individual gradients, overlooking the temporal correlations among them. Prior studies have shown that gradients exhibit spatial correlations, typically reflected in low-rank structures. Through empirical analysis, we further observe a strong temporal correlation between client gradients across adjacent rounds. Based on these observations, we propose GradESTC, a compression technique that exploits both spatial and temporal gradient correlations. GradESTC exploits spatial correlations to decompose each full gradient into a compact set of basis vectors and corresponding combination coefficients. By exploiting temporal correlations, only a small portion of the basis vectors need to be dynamically updated in each round. GradESTC significantly reduces communication overhead by transmitting lightweight combination coefficients and a limited number of updated basis vectors instead of the full gradients. Extensive experiments show that, upon reaching a target accuracy level near convergence, GradESTC reduces uplink communication by an average of 39.79% compared to the strongest baseline, while maintaining comparable convergence speed and final accuracy to uncompressed FedAvg. By effectively leveraging spatio-temporal gradient structures, GradESTC offers a practical and scalable solution for communication-efficient federated learning.

Abstract: This note introduces Projected Microbatch Accumulation (PROMA), a proximal policy update method for large language model fine-tuning. PROMA accumulates policy gradients across microbatches by projecting out sequence-wise gradient components before microbatch aggregation. The projection is applied layer-wise during the backward pass, enabling efficient implementation without additional forward or backward passes. Empirically, PROMA enforces tighter control of local KL divergence than GRPO, resulting in more stable policy learning. Unlike PPO and GRPO, PROMA achieves proximal updates without inducing entropy collapse and does not rely on a reference policy or likelihood-ratio clipping.

Abstract: Cognitive Radio (CR) systems, which dynamically adapt to changing spectrum environments, could benefit significantly from advancements in machine learning technologies. These systems can be enhanced in terms of spectral efficiency, robustness, and security through innovative approaches such as the use of Transformer models. This work investigates the application of Transformer models, specifically the GPT-2 architecture, to generate novel modulation schemes for wireless communications. By training a GPT-2 model on a dataset of existing modulation formulas, new modulation schemes has been created. These generated schemes are then compared to traditional methods using key performance metrics such as Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Power Spectrum Density (PSD). The results show that Transformer-generated modulation schemes can achieve performance comparable to, and in some cases outperforming, traditional methods. This demonstrates that advanced CR systems could greatly benefit from the implementation of Transformer models, leading to more efficient, robust, and secure communication systems.

Abstract: The predominance of machine learning models in many spheres of human activity has led to a growing demand for their transparency. The transparency of models makes it possible to discern some factors, such as security or non-discrimination. In this paper, we propose a mixture of transparent local models as an alternative solution for designing interpretable (or transparent) models. Our approach is designed for the situations where a simple and transparent function is suitable for modeling the label of instances in some localities/regions of the input space, but may change abruptly as we move from one locality to another. Consequently, the proposed algorithm is to learn both the transparent labeling function and the locality of the input space where the labeling function achieves a small risk in its assigned locality. By using a new multi-predictor (and multi-locality) loss function, we established rigorous PAC-Bayesian risk bounds for the case of binary linear classification problem and that of linear regression. In both cases, synthetic data sets were used to illustrate how the learning algorithms work. The results obtained from real data sets highlight the competitiveness of our approach compared to other existing methods as well as certain opaque models. Keywords: PAC-Bayes, risk bounds, local models, transparent models, mixtures of local transparent models.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) improve the explainability of black-box Deep Learning (DL) by introducing intermediate semantic concepts. However, standard CBMs often overlook domain-specific relationships and causal mechanisms, and their dependence on complete concept labels limits applicability in scientific domains where supervision is sparse but processes are well defined. To address this, we propose the Process-Guided Concept Bottleneck Model (PG-CBM), an extension of CBMs which constrains learning to follow domain-defined causal mechanisms through biophysically meaningful intermediate concepts. Using above ground biomass density estimation from Earth Observation data as a case study, we show that PG-CBM reduces error and bias compared to multiple benchmarks, whilst leveraging multi-source heterogeneous training data and producing interpretable intermediate outputs. Beyond improved accuracy, PG-CBM enhances transparency, enables detection of spurious learning, and provides scientific insights, representing a step toward more trustworthy AI systems in scientific applications.

Abstract: The research undertakes a comprehensive comparative analysis of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), highlighting their effectiveness in solving essential computational challenges like nonlinear function approximation, time-series prediction, and multivariate classification. Rooted in Kolmogorov's representation theorem, KANs utilize adaptive spline-based activation functions and grid-based structures, providing a transformative approach compared to traditional neural network frameworks. Utilizing a variety of datasets spanning mathematical function estimation (quadratic and cubic) to practical uses like predicting daily temperatures and categorizing wines, the proposed research thoroughly assesses model performance via accuracy measures like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and computational expense assessed through Floating Point Operations (FLOPs). The results indicate that KANs reliably exceed MLPs in every benchmark, attaining higher predictive accuracy with significantly reduced computational costs. Such an outcome highlights their ability to maintain a balance between computational efficiency and accuracy, rendering them especially beneficial in resource-limited and real-time operational environments. By elucidating the architectural and functional distinctions between KANs and MLPs, the paper provides a systematic framework for selecting the most suitable neural architectures for specific tasks. Furthermore, the proposed study highlights the transformative capabilities of KANs in progressing intelligent systems, influencing their use in situations that require both interpretability and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have emerged as a promising approach for zero-shot financial forecasting, demonstrating strong transferability and data efficiency gains. However, their adoption in financial applications is hindered by fundamental limitations in uncertainty quantification: current approaches either rely on restrictive distributional assumptions, conflate different sources of uncertainty, or lack principled calibration mechanisms. While recent TSFMs employ sophisticated techniques such as mixture models, Student's t-distributions, or conformal prediction, they fail to address the core challenge of providing theoretically-grounded uncertainty decomposition. For the very first time, we present a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework, ProbFM (probabilistic foundation model), that leverages Deep Evidential Regression (DER) to provide principled uncertainty quantification with explicit epistemic-aleatoric decomposition. Unlike existing approaches that pre-specify distributional forms or require sampling-based inference, ProbFM learns optimal uncertainty representations through higher-order evidence learning while maintaining single-pass computational efficiency. To rigorously evaluate the core DER uncertainty quantification approach independent of architectural complexity, we conduct an extensive controlled comparison study using a consistent LSTM architecture across five probabilistic methods: DER, Gaussian NLL, Student's-t NLL, Quantile Loss, and Conformal Prediction. Evaluation on cryptocurrency return forecasting demonstrates that DER maintains competitive forecasting accuracy while providing explicit epistemic-aleatoric uncertainty decomposition. This work establishes both an extensible framework for principled uncertainty quantification in foundation models and empirical evidence for DER's effectiveness in financial applications.

Abstract: Training and serving Large Language Models (LLMs) require partitioning data across multiple accelerators, where collective operations are frequently bottlenecked by network bandwidth. Lossless compression using Huffman codes is an effective way to alleviate the issue, however, its three-stage design requiring on-the-fly frequency analysis, codebook generation and transmission of codebook along with data introduces computational, latency and data overheads which are prohibitive for latency-sensitive scenarios such as die-to-die communication. This paper proposes a single-stage Huffman encoder that eliminates these overheads by using fixed codebooks derived from the average probability distribution of previous data batches. Through our analysis of the Gemma 2B model, we demonstrate that tensors exhibit high statistical similarity across layers and shards. Using this approach we achieve compression within 0.5% of per-shard Huffman coding and within 1% of the ideal Shannon compressibility, enabling efficient on-the-fly compression.

Abstract: Modeling complex dynamical systems under varying conditions is computationally intensive, often rendering high-fidelity simulations intractable. Although reduced-order models (ROMs) offer a promising solution, current methods often struggle with stochastic dynamics and fail to quantify prediction uncertainty, limiting their utility in robust decision-making contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce a data-driven framework for learning continuous-time stochastic ROMs that generalize across parameter spaces and forcing conditions. Our approach, based on amortized stochastic variational inference, leverages a reparametrization trick for Markov Gaussian processes to eliminate the need for computationally expensive forward solvers during training. This enables us to jointly learn a probabilistic autoencoder and stochastic differential equations governing the latent dynamics, at a computational cost that is independent of the dataset size and system stiffness. Additionally, our approach offers the flexibility of incorporating physics-informed priors if available. Numerical studies are presented for three challenging test problems, where we demonstrate excellent generalization to unseen parameter combinations and forcings, and significant efficiency gains compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple parties to jointly train learning models without sharing their own underlying data, offering a practical pathway to privacy-preserving collaboration under data-governance constraints. Continued study of federated learning is essential to address key challenges in it, including communication efficiency and privacy protection between parties. A recent line of work introduced a novel approach called the Communication-Efficient and Privacy-Adaptable Mechanism (CEPAM), which achieves both objectives simultaneously. CEPAM leverages the rejection-sampled universal quantizer (RSUQ), a randomized vector quantizer whose quantization error is equivalent to a prescribed noise, which can be tuned to customize privacy protection between parties. In this work, we theoretically analyze the privacy guarantees and convergence properties of CEPAM. Moreover, we assess CEPAM's utility performance through experimental evaluations, including convergence profiles compared with other baselines, and accuracy-privacy trade-offs between different parties.

Abstract: We study a semi-asynchronous client-server perceptron trained via iterative parameter mixing (IPM-style averaging): clients run local perceptron updates and a server forms a global model by aggregating the updates that arrive in each communication round. The setting captures three system effects in federated and distributed deployments: (i) stale updates due to delayed model delivery and delayed application of client computations (two-sided version lag), (ii) partial participation (intermittent client availability), and (iii) imperfect communication on both downlink and uplink, modeled as effective zero-mean additive noise with bounded second moment. We introduce a server-side aggregation rule called staleness-bucket aggregation with padding that deterministically enforces a prescribed staleness profile over update ages without assuming any stochastic model for delays or participation. Under margin separability and bounded data radius, we prove a finite-horizon expected bound on the cumulative weighted number of perceptron mistakes over a given number of server rounds: the impact of delay appears only through the mean enforced staleness, whereas communication noise contributes an additional term that grows on the order of the square root of the horizon with the total noise energy. In the noiseless case, we show how a finite expected mistake budget yields an explicit finite-round stabilization bound under a mild fresh-participation condition.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable empirical success in sampling from rich multi-modal distributions. Their inference relies on numerically solving a certain differential equation. This differential equation cannot be solved in closed form, and its resolution via discretization typically requires many small iterations to produce \emph{high-quality} samples.
  More precisely, prior works have shown that the iteration complexity of discretization methods for diffusion models scales polynomially in the ambient dimension and the inverse accuracy $1/\varepsilon$. In this work, we propose a new solver for diffusion models relying on a subtle interplay between low-degree approximation and the collocation method (Lee, Song, Vempala 2018), and we prove that its iteration complexity scales \emph{polylogarithmically} in $1/\varepsilon$, yielding the first ``high-accuracy'' guarantee for a diffusion-based sampler that only uses (approximate) access to the scores of the data distribution. In addition, our bound does not depend explicitly on the ambient dimension; more precisely, the dimension affects the complexity of our solver through the \emph{effective radius} of the support of the target distribution only.

Abstract: We present a novel differentiable grid-based representation for efficiently solving differential equations (DEs). Widely used architectures for neural solvers, such as sinusoidal neural networks, are coordinate-based MLPs that are both computationally intensive and slow to train. Although grid-based alternatives for implicit representations (e.g., Instant-NGP and K-Planes) train faster by exploiting signal structure, their reliance on linear interpolation restricts their ability to compute higher-order derivatives, rendering them unsuitable for solving DEs. Our approach overcomes these limitations by combining the efficiency of feature grids with radial basis function interpolation, which is infinitely differentiable. To effectively capture high-frequency solutions and enable stable and faster computation of global gradients, we introduce a multi-resolution decomposition with co-located grids. Our proposed representation, DInf-Grid, is trained implicitly using the differential equations as loss functions, enabling accurate modelling of physical fields. We validate DInf-Grid on a variety of tasks, including the Poisson equation for image reconstruction, the Helmholtz equation for wave fields, and the Kirchhoff-Love boundary value problem for cloth simulation. Our results demonstrate a 5-20x speed-up over coordinate-based MLP-based methods, solving differential equations in seconds or minutes while maintaining comparable accuracy and compactness.

We show that the capacity-achieving distribution as SNR goes to infinity is given by a discrete Gaussian distribution supported on a scaled integer lattice. Further, we show that the gap between the input entropy and the capacity decreases to zero exponentially in SNR, and characterize this exponent.

Abstract: We introduce the one-cold Poisson channel (OCPC), where the transmitter chooses one of several frequency bands to attenuate at a time. In particular, the perfect OCPC, where the number of bands is unlimited, is an extremely simple continuous-time memoryless channel. It has a capacity 1, zero channel dispersion, and an information spectrum being the degenerate distribution at 1. It is the only known nontrivial (discrete or continuous-time) memoryless channel with a closed-form formula for its optimal non-asymptotic error probability, making it the simplest channel in this sense. A potential application is optical communication with a tunable band rejection filter. Due to its simplicity, we may use it as a basic currency of information that is infinitely divisible, as an alternative to bits which are not infinitely divisible. OCPC with perfect feedback gives a generalization of prefix codes. We also study non-asymptotic coding and channel simulation results for the general OCPC.

Abstract: The sequence reconstruction problem, introduced by Levenshtein in 2001, considers a communication setting in which a sender transmits a codeword and the receiver observes K independent noisy versions of this codeword. In this work, we study the problem of efficient reconstruction when each of the $K$ outputs is corrupted by a $q$-ary discrete memoryless symmetric (DMS) substitution channel with substitution probability $p$. Focusing on Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, we adapt the Koetter-Vardy soft-decision decoding algorithm to obtain an efficient reconstruction algorithm. For sufficiently large blocklength and alphabet size, we derive an explicit rate threshold, depending only on $(p, K)$, such that the transmitted codeword can be reconstructed with arbitrarily small probability of error whenever the code rate $R$ lies below this threshold.

Abstract: We design new minimal-subpacketization schemes for information-theoretic private information retrieval on graph-based replicated databases. In graph-based replication, the system consists of $K$ files replicated across $N$ servers according to a graph with $N$ vertices and $K$ edges. The client wants to retrieve one desired file, while keeping the index of the desired file private from each server via a query-response protocol. We seek PIR protocols that have (a) high rate, which is the ratio of the file-size to the total download cost, and (b) low subpacketization, which acts as a constraint on the size of the files for executing the protocol. We report two new schemes which have unit-subpacketization (which is minimal): (i) for a special class of graphs known as star graphs, and (ii) for general graphs. Our star-graph scheme has a better rate than previously known schemes with low subpacketization for general star graphs. Our scheme for general graphs uses a decomposition of the graph via independent sets. This scheme achieves a rate lower than prior schemes for the complete graph, however it can achieve higher rates than known for some specific graph classes. An extension of our scheme to the case of multigraphs achieves a higher rate than previous schemes for the complete multi-graph.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of leaky-private Private Information Retrieval with Side Information (L-PIR-SI), which relaxes the requirement of perfect privacy to achieve improved communication efficiency in the presence of side information. While the capacities of PIR-SI under both $W$-privacy and $(W,S)$-privacy have been partially explored, the impact of controlled information leakage in these settings remains unaddressed. We propose a unified probabilistic framework to construct L-PIR-SI schemes where the privacy leakage is quantified by a parameter $\varepsilon$, consistent with differential privacy standards. We characterize the achievable download costs and show that our results generalize several landmark results in the PIR literature: they recover the capacity of PIR-SI when $\varepsilon \to 0$, and reduce to the known bounds for leaky-PIR when side information is absent. This work provides the first look at the trade-offs between leakage, side information, and retrieval efficiency.

Abstract: Coded polynomial aggregation (CPA) enables the master to directly recover a weighted aggregation of polynomial evaluations without individually decoding each term, thereby reducing the number of required worker responses. In this paper, we extend CPA to straggler-aware distributed computing systems and introduce a straggler-aware CPA framework with pre-specified non-straggler patterns, where exact recovery is required only for a given collection of admissible non-straggler sets. Our main result shows that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than required by polynomial coded computing based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is fundamentally characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA and identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. We further prove that this threshold becomes both necessary and sufficient when the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold. Finally, simulations reveal a sharp feasibility transition at the predicted threshold, providing empirical evidence that the bound is tight in practice.

Abstract: Function-Correcting Codes (FCCs) enable reliable computation of a function of a $k$-bit message over noisy channels without requiring full message recovery. In this work, we study optimal single-error correcting FCCs (SEFCCs) for maximally-unbalanced Boolean functions, where $k$ denotes the message length and $t$ denotes the error-correction capability. We analyze the structure of optimal SEFCC constructions through their associated codeword distance matrices and identify distinct FCC classes based on this structure. We then examine the impact of these structural differences on error performance by evaluating representative FCCs over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel using both soft-decision and hard-decision decoding. The results show that FCCs with different distance-matrix structures can exhibit markedly different Data BER and function error behavior, and that the influence of code structure depends strongly on the decoding strategy.

Abstract: Quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes with large girths play a crucial role in several research and application fields, including channel coding, compressed sensing and distributed storage systems. A major challenge in respect of the code construction is how to obtain such codes with the shortest possible length (or equivalently, the smallest possible circulant size) using algebraic methods instead of search methods. The greatest-common-divisor (GCD) framework we previously proposed has algebraically constructed QC-LDPC codes with column weights of 5 and 6, very short lengths, and a girth of 8. By introducing the concept of a mirror sequence and adopting a new row-regrouping scheme, QC-LDPC codes with column weights of 7 and 8, very short lengths, and a girth of 8 are proposed for arbitrary row weights in this article via an algebraic manner under the GCD framework. Thanks to these novel algebraic methods, the lower bounds (for column weights 7 and 8) on consecutive circulant sizes are both improved by asymptotically about 20%, compared with the existing benchmarks. Furthermore, these new constructions can also offer circulant sizes asymptotically about 25% smaller than the novel bounds.

Abstract: This paper studies the multi-access coded caching (MACC) problem under arbitrary user-cache access topologies, extending existing models that rely on highly structured and combinatorially designed connectivity. We consider a MACC system consisting of a single server, multiple cache nodes, and multiple user nodes. Each user can access an arbitrary subset of cache nodes to retrieve cached content. The objective is to design a general and low-complexity delivery scheme under fixed cache placement for arbitrary access topologies. We propose a universal graph-based framework for modeling the MACC delivery problem, where decoding conflicts among requested packets are captured by a conflict graph and the delivery design is reduced to a graph coloring problem. In this formulation, a lower transmission load corresponds to using fewer colors. The classical greedy coloring algorithm DSatur achieves a transmission load close to the index-coding converse bound, providing a tight benchmark, but its computational complexity becomes prohibitive for large-scale graphs. To overcome this limitation, we develop a learning-based framework using graph neural networks that efficiently constructs near-optimal coded multicast transmissions and generalizes across diverse access topologies and varying numbers of users. In addition, we extend the index-coding converse bound for uncoded cache placement to arbitrary access topologies and propose a low-complexity greedy approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based scheme achieves transmission loads close to those of DSatur and the converse bound while significantly reducing computational time.

Abstract: We introduce the sum channel, a new channel model motivated by applications in distributed storage and DNA data storage. In the error-free case, it takes as input an $\ell$-row binary matrix and outputs an $(\ell+1)$-row matrix whose first $\ell$ rows equal the input and whose last row is their parity (sum) row. We construct a two-deletion-correcting code with redundancy $2\lceil\log_2\log_2 n\rceil + O(\ell^2)$ for $\ell$-row inputs. When $\ell=2$, we establish an upper bound of $\lceil\log_2\log_2 n\rceil + O(1)$, implying that our redundancy is optimal up to a factor of 2. We also present a code correcting a single substitution with $\lceil \log_2(\ell+1)\rceil$ redundant bits and prove that it is within one bit of optimality.

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of noisy frequency-based channels, motivated by DNA data storage in the short-molecule regime, where information is encoded in the frequency of items types rather than their order. The channel output is a histogram formed by random sampling of items, followed by noisy item identification. While the capacity of the noiseless frequency-based channel has been previously addressed, the effect of identification noise has not been fully characterized. We present a converse bound on the channel capacity that follows from stochastic degradation and the data processing inequality. We then establish an achievable bound, which is based on a Poissonization of the multinomial sampling process, and an analysis of the resulting vector Poisson channel with inter-symbol interference. This analysis refines concentration inequalities for the information density used in Feinstein bound, and explicitly characterizes an additive loss in the mutual information due to identification noise. We apply our results to a DNA storage channel in the short-molecule regime, and quantify the resulting loss in the scaling of the total number of reliably stored bits.

Abstract: Distributed storage systems must handle both data heterogeneity, arising from non-uniform access demands, and device heterogeneity, caused by time-varying node reliability. In this paper, we study convertible codes, which enable the transformation of one code into another with minimum cost in the merge regime, addressing the latter. We derive general lower bounds on the read and write costs of linear code conversion, applicable to arbitrary linear codes. We then focus on Reed-Muller codes, which efficiently handle data heterogeneity, addressing the former issue, and construct explicit conversion procedures that, for the first time, combine both forms of heterogeneity for distributed data storage.

Abstract: In the $(L,K,M,N)$ cache-aided multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel (BC) system, the server is equipped with $L$ antennas and communicates with $K$ single-antenna users through a wireless broadcast channel where the server has a library containing $N$ files, and each user is equipped with a cache of size $M$ files. Under the constraints of uncoded placement and one-shot linear delivery strategies, many schemes achieve the maximum sum Degree-of-Freedom (sum-DoF). However, for general parameters $L$, $M$, and $N$, their subpacketizations increase exponentially with the number of users. We aim to design a MISO coded caching scheme that achieves a large sum-DoF with low subpacketization $F$. An interesting combinatorial structure, called the multiple-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA), can be used to generate MISO coded caching schemes under these two strategies; moreover, all existing schemes with these strategies can be represented by the corresponding MAPDAs. In this paper, we study the case with $F=K$ (i.e., $F$ grows linearly with $K$) by investigating MAPDAs. Specifically, based on the framework of Latin squares, we transform the design of MAPDA with $F=K$ into the construction of a combinatorial structure called the $L$-half-sum disjoint packing (HSDP). It is worth noting that a $1$-HSDP is exactly the concept of NHSDP, which is used to generate the shared-link coded caching scheme with $F=K$. By constructing $L$-HSDPs, we obtain a class of new schemes with $F=K$. Finally, theoretical and numerical analyses show that our $L$-HSDP schemes significantly reduce subpacketization compared to existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, while only slightly sacrificing sum-DoF, and achieve both a higher sum-DoF and lower subpacketization than the existing schemes with linear subpacketization.

Abstract: Polar codes can be viewed as decreasing monomial codes, revealing a rich algebraic structure governed by the lower-triangular affine (LTA) group. We develop a general framework to compute the Hamming weight of codewords generated by sums of monomials, express these weights in a canonical dyadic form, and derive closed expressions for key structural templates (disjoint sums, nested blocks, complementary flips) that generate the low and intermediate weight spectrum. Combining these templates with the LTA group action, we obtain explicit multiplicity formulas, yielding a unified algebraic method to characterize and enumerate codewords.

Abstract: Polar codes are usually constructed by ranking synthetic bit-channels according to reliability, which guarantees capacity-achieving behavior but can yield poor low-weight spectra at short and moderate lengths. Recent algebraic results express the contribution of individual bit-channels to the multiplicities of minimum and near-minimum weight codewords in closed form. In this work we combine these insights into a mixed (reliability--weight) bit-channel ordering. We define a per-bit cost whose distance term is derived from orbit enumeration of minimum-weight codewords and scaled by a Bhattacharyya-type factor, and show that the resulting mixed construction minimises a truncated SC/ML union-bound surrogate within a class of decreasing monomial codes. We relate the mixed metric to error events in SCL decoding via a pruning/ML decomposition, and prove that mixed designs act as local perturbations of reliability-based constructions whose asymptotic impact vanishes as code-length approaches infinity. Numerical results for short and moderate lengths on BPSK-AWGN, implemented via Gaussian approximation and closed-form weight contributions, illustrate the trade-off between pure reliability-based and mixed constructions in terms of minimum distance, multiplicity, and union-bound approximations. All proofs are deferred to the appendices.

Abstract: In this paper, we study efficient codebook design for limited feedback in extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. It is worth noting that existing codebook designs for XL-MIMO, such as polar-domain codebook, have not well taken into account user (location) distribution in practice, thereby incurring excessive feedback overhead. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel and efficient feedback codebook tailored to user distribution. To this end, we first consider a typical scenario where users are uniformly distributed within a specific polar-region, based on which a sum-rate maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize angle-range samples and bit allocation among angle/range feedback. This problem is challenging to solve due to the lack of a closed-form expression for the received power in terms of angle and range samples. By leveraging a Voronoi partitioning approach, we show that uniform angle sampling is optimal for received power maximization. For more challenging range sampling design, we obtain a tight lower-bound on the received power and show that geometric sampling, where the ratio between adjacent samples is constant, can maximize the lower bound and thus serves as a high-quality suboptimal solution. We then extend the proposed framework to accommodate more general non-uniform user distribution via an alternating sampling method. Furthermore, theoretical analysis reveals that as the array size increases, the optimal allocation of feedback bits increasingly favors range samples at the expense of angle samples. Finally, numerical results validate the superior rate performance and robustness of the proposed codebook design under various system setups, achieving significant gains over benchmark schemes, including the widely used polar-domain codebook.

Abstract: The multiaccess coded caching (MACC) system, as formulated by Hachem {\it et al.}, consists of a central server with a library of $N$ files, connected to $K$ cache-less users via an error-free shared link, and $K$ cache nodes, each equipped with cache memory of size $M$ files. Each user can access $L$ neighboring cache nodes under a cyclic wrap-around topology. Most existing studies operate under the strong assumption that users can retrieve content from their connected cache nodes at no communication cost. In practice, each user retrieves content from its $L$ different connected cache nodes at varying costs. Additionally, the server also incurs certain costs to transmit the content to the users. In this paper, we focus on a cost-aware MACC system and aim to minimize the total system cost, which includes cache-access costs and broadcast costs. Firstly, we propose a novel coded caching framework based on superposition coding, where the MACC schemes of Cheng \textit{et al.} are layered. Then, a cost-aware optimization problem is derived that optimizes cache placement and minimizes system cost. By identifying a sparsity property of the optimal solution, we propose a structure-aware algorithm with reduced complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme consistently outperforms the scheme of Cheng {\it et al.} in scenarios with heterogeneous retrieval costs.

Abstract: We consider a $(G,L,K,M,N)$ cache-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network, where a server equipped with $L$ antennas and a library of $N$ equal-size files communicates with $K$ users, each equipped with $G$ antennas and a cache of size $M$ files, over a wireless interference channel. Each user requests an arbitrary file from the library. The goal is to design coded caching schemes that simultaneously achieve the maximum sum degrees of freedom (sum-DoF) and low subpacketization. In this paper, we first introduce a unified combinatorial structure, termed the MIMO placement delivery array (MIMO-PDA), which characterizes uncoded placement and one-shot zero-forcing delivery. By analyzing the combinatorial properties of MIMO-PDAs, we derive a sum-DoF upper bound of $\min\{KG, Gt+G\lceil L/G \rceil\}$, where $t=KM/N$, which coincides with the optimal DoF characterization in prior work by Tehrani \emph{et al.}. Based on this upper bound, we present two novel constructions of MIMO-PDAs that achieve the maximum sum-DoF. The first construction achieves linear subpacketization under stringent parameter constraints, while the second achieves ordered exponential subpacketization under substantially milder constraints. Theoretical analysis and numerical comparisons demonstrate that the second construction exponentially reduces subpacketization compared to existing schemes while preserving the maximum sum-DoF.

Abstract: Building on the well-established capacity-achieving schemes of Sun-Jafar (for replicated storage) and the closely related scheme of Banawan-Ulukus (for MDS-coded setting), a recent work by Chandan et al. proposed new classes of weak private information retrieval (WPIR) schemes for the collusion-free (replication and MDS-coded) setting, as well as for the $T$-colluding scenario. In their work, Chandan et al. characterized the expressions for the rate-privacy trade-offs for these classes of WPIR schemes, under the mutual information leakage and maximal leakage metrics. Explicit achievable trade-offs for the same were also presented, which were shown to be competitive or better than prior WPIR schemes. However, the class-wise optimality of the reported trade-offs were unknown. In this work, we show that the explicit rate-privacy trade-offs reported for the Sun-Jafar-type schemes by Chandan et al. are optimal for the non-colluding and replicated setting. Furthermore, we prove the class-wise optimality for Banawan-Ulukus-type MDS-WPIR and Sun-Jafar-type $T$-colluding WPIR schemes, under threshold-constraints on the system parameters. When these threshold-constraints do not hold, we present counter-examples which show that even higher rates than those reported before can be achieved.

Abstract: This paper investigates the coded caching problem in a multi-access multiple-input single-output (MAMISO) network with the combinatorial topology. The considered system consists of a server containing $N$ files, $Λ$ cache nodes, and $K$ cache-less users, where each user can access a unique subset of $r$ cache nodes. The server is equipped with $L$ transmit antennas. Our objective is to design a caching scheme that simultaneously achieves a high sum Degree of Freedom (sum-DoF) and low subpacketization complexity. To address this challenge, we formulate the design of multi-antenna placement delivery arrays (MAPDA) as a $0$--$1$ knapsack problem to maximize the achievable DoF, thereby transforming the complex combinatorial caching structure into a tractable optimization framework that yields efficient cache placement and flexible delivery strategies. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate that: for networks with combinatorial topologies, the proposed scheme achieves a higher sum-DoF than existing schemes. Under identical cache size constraints, the subpacketization level remains comparable to existing linear subpacketization schemes. Moreover, under specific system conditions, the proposed scheme attains the theoretical maximum sum-DoF of $\min\{L+KM/N, K\}$ while achieving further reductions subpacketization. For particular combinatorial structures, we further derive optimized constructions that achieve even higher sum-DoF with lower subpacketization. ```

Abstract: We study hotplug coded caching in combinatorial multi-access networks, which generalizes existing hotplug coded caching models by allowing users to access multiple caches, while only a subset of caches is online during the delivery phase. We first generalize the Hotplug Placement Delivery Array (HpPDA) framework to the combinatorial multi-access setting. Based on this generalized framework, we propose a t-design-based coded caching scheme for combinatorial multi-access networks. We characterize a class of design parameters under which every active user has access to a sufficient number of coded subfiles to decode its requested file, and show that appropriate parameter choices allow for the elimination of redundant multicast transmissions. As a result, the proposed scheme achieves a family of rate memory trade offs with flexible subpacketization. We present numerical comparisons illustrating that the proposed t-scheme outperforms existing hotplug coded caching schemes in certain memory regimes.

Abstract: Coded caching is recognized as an effective method for alleviating network congestion during peak periods by leveraging local caching and coded multicasting gains. The key challenge in designing coded caching schemes lies in simultaneously achieving low subpacketization and low transmission load. Most existing schemes require exponential or polynomial subpacketization levels, while some linear subpacketization schemes often result in excessive transmission load. Recently, Cheng et al. proposed a construction framework for linear coded caching schemes called Non-Half-Sum Disjoint Packing (NHSDP), where the subpacketization equals the number of users $K$. This paper introduces a novel combinatorial structure, termed the Non-Half-Sum Latin Rectangle (NHSLR), which extends the framework of linear coded caching schemes from $F=K$ (i.e., the construction via NHSDP) to a broader scenario with $F=\mathcal{O}(K)$. By constructing NHSLR, we have obtained a new class of coded caching schemes that achieves linearly scalable subpacketization, while further reducing the transmission load compared with the NHSDP scheme. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate that the proposed schemes not only achieves lower transmission load than existing linear subpacketization schemes but also approaches the performance of certain exponential subpacketization schemes.

Abstract: We consider the $(K,L,M,N)$ multi-access coded caching system introduced by Hachem et al., which consists of a central server with $N$ files and $K$ cache nodes, each of memory size $M$, where each user can access $L$ cache nodes in a cyclic wrap-around fashion. At present, several existing schemes achieve competitive transmission performance, but their subpacketization levels grow exponentially with the number of users. In contrast, schemes with linear or polynomial subpacketization always incur higher transmission loads. We aim to design a multi-access coded caching scheme with linear subpacketization $F$ while maintaining low transmission load. Recently, Cheng et al. proposed a construction framework for coded caching schemes with linear subpacketization (i.e., $F=K$) called non-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP). Inspired by this structure, we introduce a novel combinatorial structure named cyclic multi-access non-half-sum disjoint packing (CMA-NHSDP) by extending NHSDP to MACC system. By constructing CMA-NHSDP, we obtain a new class of multi-access coded caching schemes. Theoretical and numerical analyses show that our scheme achieves lower transmission loads than some existing schemes with linear subpacketization. Moreover, the proposed schemes achieves lower transmission load compared to existing schemes with exponential subpacketization in some case.

Abstract: We study a binary distributed hypothesis testing problem where two agents observe correlated binary vectors and communicate compressed information at the same rate to a central decision maker. In particular, we study linear compression schemes and show that simple truncation is the best linear scheme in two cases: (1) testing opposite signs of the same magnitude of correlation, and (2) testing for or against independence. We conjecture, supported by numerical evidence, that truncation is the best linear code for testing any correlations of opposite signs. Further, for testing against independence, we also compute classical random coding exponents and show that truncation, and consequently any linear code, is strictly suboptimal.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a cornerstone technology for 6G networks, offering unified support for high-rate communication and high-accuracy sensing. While existing literature extensively covers link-level designs, the transition toward large-scale deployment necessitates a fundamental understanding of network-level performance. This paper investigates a network ISAC model where a source node communicates with a destination via a relay network, while intermediate nodes concurrently perform cooperative sensing over specific spatial regions. We formulate a novel optimization framework that captures the interplay between multi-node routing and sensing coverage. For a one-dimensional path network, we provide an analytical characterization of the complete sensing-throughput region. Extending this to general network topologies, we establish that the sensing-throughput Pareto boundary is piecewise linear and provide physical interpretations for each segment. Our results reveal the fundamental trade-offs between sensing coverage and communication routing, offering key insights for the design of future 6G heterogeneous networks.

Abstract: Burst errors involving simultaneous insertions, deletions, and substitutions occur in practical scenarios, including DNA data storage and document synchronization, motivating developments of channel codes that can correct such errors. In this paper, we address the problem of constructing error-correcting codes (ECCs) capable of handling multiple bursts of $t_1$-deletion-$t_2$-insertion ($(t_1,t_2)$-DI) errors, where each burst consists of $t_1$ deletions followed by $t_2$ insertions in a binary sequence. We make three key contributions: Firstly, we establish the fundamental equivalence of (1) two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs, (2) two bursts of $(t_2,t_1)$-DI ECCs, and (3) one burst each of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI and $(t_2,t_1)$-DI ECCs. Then, we derive lower and upper bounds on the code size of two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs, which can naturally be extended to the case of multiple bursts. Finally, we present constructions of two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs. Compared to the codes obtained by the syndrome compression technique, the resulting codes achieve significantly lower computational complexity.

Abstract: Given the compressed sensing measurements of an unknown vector $z \in \mathbb{R}^n$ using random matrices, we present a simple method to determine $z$ without solving any optimization problem or linear system. Our method uses $Θ(\log n)$ random sensing matrices in $\mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$ and runs in $O(kn\log n)$ time, where $k = Θ(s\log n)$ and $s$ is the number of nonzero coordinates in $z$. We adapt our method to determine the support set of $z$ and experimentally compare with some optimization-based methods on binary signals.

Abstract: This work establishes the fundamental limits of the classical problem of multi-user distributed computing of linearly separable functions. In particular, we consider a distributed computing setting involving $L$ users, each requesting a linearly separable function over $K$ basis subfunctions from a master node, who is assisted by $N$ distributed servers. At the core of this problem lies a fundamental tradeoff between communication and computation: each server can compute up to $M$ subfunctions, and each server can communicate linear combinations of their locally computed subfunctions outputs to at most $Δ$ users. The objective is to design a distributed computing scheme that reduces the communication cost (total amount of data from servers to users), and towards this, for any given $K$, $L$, $M$, and $Δ$, we propose a distributed computing scheme that jointly designs the task assignment and transmissions, and shows that the scheme achieves optimal performance in the real field under various conditions using a novel converse. We also characterize the performance of the scheme in the finite field using another converse based on counting arguments.

Abstract: Coded computing has become a key framework for reliable distributed computation over decentralized networks, effectively mitigating the impact of stragglers. Although there exists a wide range of coded computing methods to handle both polynomial and non-polynomial functions, computing methods for the latter class have received traction due its inherent challenges in reconstructing non-polynomial functions using a finite number of evaluations. Among them, the state-of-the-art method is Berrut Approximated coded computing, wherein Berrut interpolants, are used for approximating the non-polynomial function. However, since Berrut interpolants have global support characteristics, such methods are known to offer degraded accuracy when the number of stragglers is large. To address this challenge, we propose a coded computing framework based on cubic B-spline interpolation. In our approach, server-side function evaluations are reconstructed at the master node using B-splines, exploiting their local support and smoothness properties to enhance stability and accuracy. We provide a systematic methodology for integrating B-spline interpolation into coded computing and derive theoretical bounds on approximation error in terms of the number of servers and stragglers. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our framework significantly outperforms Berrut-based methods for various non-polynomial functions.

Abstract: We study a one-shot joint source-channel coding setting where the source is encoded once and broadcast to $K$ decoders through independent channels. Success is predicated on at least one decoder recovering the source within a maximum distortion constraint. We find that in the one-shot regime, utilizing disjoint codebooks at each decoder yields a codebook diversity gain, distinct from the channel diversity gain that may be expected when several decoders observe independent realizations of the channel's output but share the same codebook. Coding schemes are introduced that leverage this phenomenon, where first- and second-order achievability bounds are derived via an adaptation of the Poisson matching lemma (Li and Anantharam, 2021) which allows for multiple decoders using disjoint codebooks. We further propose a hybrid coding scheme that partitions decoders into groups to optimally balance codebook and channel diversity. Numerical results on the binary symmetric channel demonstrate that the hybrid approach outperforms strategies where the decoders' codebooks are either fully shared or disjoint.

Abstract: This work investigates the use of quantum resources in distributed storage systems. Consider an $(n,k,d)$ distributed storage system in which a file is stored across $n$ nodes such that any $k$ nodes suffice to reconstruct the file. When a node fails, any $d$ helper nodes transmit information to a newcomer to rebuild the system. In contrast to the classical repair, where helper nodes transmit classical bits, we allow them to send classical information over quantum channels to the newcomer. The newcomer then generates its storage by performing appropriate measurements on the received quantum states. In this setting, we fully characterize the fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth (total communication cost). Compared to classical systems, the optimal storage--bandwidth tradeoff can be significantly improved with the enhancement of quantum entanglement shared only among the surviving nodes, particularly at the minimum-storage regenerating point. Remarkably, we show that when $d \geq 2k-2$, there exists an operating point at which \textit{both storage and repair bandwidth are simultaneously minimized}. This phenomenon breaks the tradeoff in the classical setting and reveals a fundamentally new regime enabled by quantum communication.

Abstract: It is well-known in the field of lossless data compression that probabilistic next-symbol prediction can be used to compress sequences of symbols. Deep neural networks are able to capture rich dependencies in data, offering a powerful means of estimating these probabilities and hence an avenue towards more effective compression algorithms. However, both compressor and decompressor must have exactly matching predictions; even small non-deterministic differences (which often happen with learned models due to hardware, software, or computation order) can lead to cascading decoding failures. In this paper, we formalize the problem of prediction mismatch in model-driven compression, and introduce Probability Matching Interval Coding (PMATIC), a model-agnostic algorithm that tolerates bounded prediction mismatch with low overhead. PMATIC works with the predicted probabilities, making it compatible as a drop-in replacement for the arithmetic encoder in model-driven compression tools. We show theoretical correctness and performance bounds for PMATIC, and validate these results on text data. These results confirm that, when paired an advanced prediction model, PMATIC is robust to prediction mismatch while achieving compression rates that out-perform standard modern compression tools.

Abstract: We develop a one-out-of-two-oblivious transfer protocol over the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise channel using polar codes. The scheme uses two decoder views linked by automorphisms of the polar transform and publicly draws the encoder at random from the corresponding automorphism group. This yields perfect receiver privacy at any finite blocklength, since the public encoder distribution is independent of the receiver's choice bit. Sender privacy is obtained asymptotically via channel polarization combined with privacy amplification. Because the construction deliberately injects randomness on selected bad bit-channels, we derive a relaxed reliability criterion and evaluate finite-blocklength performance. Finally, we characterize the polar-transform automorphisms as bit-level permutations of bit-channel indices, and exploit this structure to derive and optimize an achievable finite-blocklength OT rate.

Abstract: Maximum-distance-separable (MDS) codes are widely used in distributed storage, yet naive repair of a single erasure in an $[n,k]$ MDS code downloads the entire contents of $k$ nodes. Minimum Storage Regenerating (MSR) codes (Dimakis et al., 2010) minimize repair bandwidth by contacting $d>k$ helpers and downloading only a fraction of data from each. Guruswami and Wootters first proposed a linear repair scheme for Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, showing that they can be repaired with lower bandwidth than the naive approach. The existence of RS codes achieving the MSR point (RS-MSR codes) nevertheless remained open until the breakthrough construction of Tamo, Barg, and Ye, which yields RS-MSR codes with subpacketization $\ell = s \prod_{i=1}^n p_i$, where $p_i$ are distinct primes satisfying $p_i \equiv 1 \pmod{s}$ and $s=d+1-k$.
  In this paper, we present an improved construction of RS-MSR codes by eliminating the congruence condition $p_i \equiv 1 \pmod{s}$. Consequently, our construction reduces the subpacketization by a multiplicative factor of $φ(s)^n$ ( $φ(\cdot)$ is Euler's totient function) and broadens the range of feasible parameters for RS-MSR codes.

Abstract: Nitinawarat and Narayan proposed a perfect secret key generation scheme for the so-called \emph{pairwise independent network (PIN) model} by exploiting the combinatorial properties of the underlying graph, namely the spanning tree packing rate. This work considers a generalization of the PIN model where the underlying graph is replaced with a hypergraph, and makes progress towards designing similar perfect secret key generation schemes by exploiting the combinatorial properties of the hypergraph.
  Our contributions are two-fold. We first provide a capacity achieving scheme for a complete $t$-uniform hypergraph on $m$ vertices by leveraging a packing of the complete $t$-uniform hypergraphs by what we refer to as star hypergraphs, and designing a scheme that gives $\binom{m-2}{t-2}$ bits of perfect secret key per star graph. Our second contribution is a 2-bit perfect secret key generation scheme for 3-uniform star hypergraphs whose projections are cycles. This scheme is then extended to a perfect secret key generation scheme for generic 3-uniform hypergraphs by exploiting star graph packing of 3-uniform hypergraphs and Hamiltonian packings of graphs. The scheme is then shown to be capacity achieving for certain classes of hypergraphs.

Abstract: In this paper, we develop an optimal control framework for dynamical systems when only an approximate model of the underlying plant is available. We consider a setting in which the control strategy is synthesized using a model-based optimal control problem that includes a penalty term capturing deviation from the plant trajectory, while the same control input is applied to both the model and the actual system. For a general class of optimal control problems, we establish conditions under which the control minimizing the model-based Hamiltonian coincides with the plant-optimal control, despite mismatch between the model and the true dynamics. We further specialize these results to problems with quadratic control effort, where explicit and easily verifiable sufficient conditions guarantee equivalence and uniqueness of the resulting optimal control. These results show that accurate control synthesis does not require an exact model of the underlying system, but rather alignment of the optimality conditions that govern control selection. From a learning perspective, this suggests that data-driven efforts can focus on identifying regimes in which model-based and plant-based Hamiltonian minimizers coincide, thereby providing a theoretical basis for robust model-based decision making and the effective use of digital twins under modeling error. We provide examples to illustrate the theoretical findings and demonstrate equivalence of the resulting control trajectories even in the presence of significant model mismatch.

Abstract: We study the subgradient method for factorized robust signal recovery problems, including robust PCA, robust phase retrieval, and robust matrix sensing. These objectives are nonsmooth and nonconvex, and may have unbounded sublevel sets, so standard arguments for analyzing first-order optimization algorithms based on descent and coercivity do not apply. For locally Lipschitz semialgebraic objectives, we develop a convergence framework under the assumption that continuous-time subgradient trajectories are bounded: for sufficiently small step sizes of order \(1/k\), any subgradient sequence remains bounded and converges to a critical point. We verify this trajectory boundedness assumption for the robust objectives by adapting and extending existing trajectory analyses, requiring only a mild nondegeneracy condition in the matrix sensing case. Finally, for rank-one symmetric robust PCA, we show that the subgradient method avoids spurious critical points for almost every initialization, and therefore converges to a global minimum under the same step-size regime.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel reformulation of the smooth nonconvex-strongly-concave (NC-SC) minimax problems that casts the problem as a joint minimization. We show that our reformulation preserves not only first-order stationarity, but also global and local optimality, second-order stationarity, and the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KL) property, of the original NC-SC problem, which is substantially stronger than its nonsmooth counterpart in the literature. With these enhanced structures, we design a versatile parameter-free and nonmonotone line-search framework that does not require evaluating the inner maximization. Under mild conditions, global convergence rates can be obtained, and, with KL property, full sequence convergence with asymptotic rates is also established. In particular, we show our framework is compatible with the gradient descent-ascent (GDA) algorithm. By equipping GDA with Barzilai-Borwein (BB) step sizes and nonmonotone line-search, our method exhibits superior numerical performance against the compared benchmarks.

Abstract: We introduce a scaled controllability Gramian that can be computed reliably even for unstable systems. Using this scaled Gramian, we reformulate the controllability scoring problems into equivalent but numerically stable optimization problems. Their optimal solutions define dynamics-aware network centrality measures, referred to as the volumetric controllability score (VCS) and the average energy controllability score (AECS). We then formulate controllability scoring problems on an infinite time horizon. Under suitable assumptions, we prove that the resulting VCS and AECS are unique and that the finite-horizon scores converge to them. We further show that VCS and AECS can differ markedly in this limit, because VCS enforces controllability of the full system, whereas AECS accounts only for the stable modes. Finally, using Laplacian dynamics as a representative example, we present numerical experiments that illustrate this convergence.

Abstract: In this paper, a two-step inertial Tseng extragradient method involving self-adaptive and Armijo-like step sizes is introduced for solving variational inequalities with a quasimonotone cost function in the setting of a real Hilbert space. Weak convergence of the sequence generated by the proposed algorithm is proved without assuming the Lipschitz condition. An interesting feature of the proposed algorithm is its ability to select the better step size between the self-adaptive and Armijo-like options at each iteration step. Moreover, removing the requirement for the Lipschitz condition on the cost function broadens the applicability of the proposed method. Finally, the algorithm accelerates and complements several existing iterative algorithms for solving variational inequalities in Hilbert spaces.

Abstract: This paper addresses the study of algebraic versions of Farkas lemma and strong duality results in the very broad setting of infinite-dimensional conic linear programming in dual pairs of vector spaces. To this end, purely algebraic properties of perturbed optimal value functions of both primal and dual problems and their corresponding hypergraph/epigraph are investigated. The newly developed hypergraphical/epigraphical sets, inspired by Kretschmer's closedness conditions \cite{Kretschmer61}, together with their novel convex separation-type characterizations, give rise to various perturbed Farkas-type lemmas which allow us to derive complete characterizations of ``zero duality gap''. Principally, when certain structures of algebraic or topological duals are imposed, illuminating implications of the developed condition are also explored.

Abstract: This paper presents a geometric framework for analyzing output-feedback and input-feedforward passivization of linear time-invariant systems. We reveal that a system is passivizable with a given passivity index when the Nyquist plot for SISO systems or the Rayleigh quotient of the transfer function for MIMO systems lies within a specific, index-dependent region in the complex plane, termed the positive damping region. The criteria enable a convenient graphic tool for analyzing the passivization, the associated frequency bands, the maximum achievable passivity index, and the waterbed effect between them. Additionally, the tool can be encoded into classical tools such as the Nyquist plot, the Nichols plot, and the generalized KYP lemma to aid control design. Finally, we demonstrate its application in passivity-based power system stability analysis and discuss its implications for electrical engineers regarding device controller design trade-offs.

Abstract: We study the high-dimensional training dynamics of a shallow neural network with quadratic activation in a teacher-student setup. We focus on the extensive-width regime, where the teacher and student network widths scale proportionally with the input dimension, and the sample size grows quadratically. This scaling aims to describe overparameterized neural networks in which feature learning still plays a central role. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive a dynamical characterization of the gradient flow, in the spirit of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Under l2-regularization, we analyze these equations at long times and characterize the performance and spectral properties of the resulting estimator. This result provides a quantitative understanding of the effect of overparameterization on learning and generalization, and reveals a double descent phenomenon in the presence of label noise, where generalization improves beyond interpolation. In the small regularization limit, we obtain an exact expression for the perfect recovery threshold as a function of the network widths, providing a precise characterization of how overparameterization influences recovery.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Submodular maximization subject to matroid constraints is a central problem with many applications in machine learning. As algorithms are increasingly used in decision-making over datapoints with sensitive attributes such as gender or race, it is becoming crucial to enforce fairness to avoid bias and discrimination. Recent work has addressed the challenge of developing efficient approximation algorithms for fair matroid submodular maximization. However, the best algorithms known so far are only guaranteed to satisfy a relaxed version of the fairness constraints that loses a factor 2, i.e., the problem may ask for $\ell$ elements with a given attribute, but the algorithm is only guaranteed to find $\lfloor \ell/2 \rfloor$. In particular, there is no provable guarantee when $\ell=1$, which corresponds to a key special case of perfect matching constraints.
  In this work, we achieve a new trade-off via an algorithm that gets arbitrarily close to full fairness. Namely, for any constant $\varepsilon>0$, we give a constant-factor approximation to fair monotone matroid submodular maximization that in expectation loses only a factor $(1-\varepsilon)$ in the lower-bound fairness constraint. Our empirical evaluation on a standard suite of real-world datasets -- including clustering, recommendation, and coverage tasks -- demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our methods.

Abstract: Model counting of Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) formulas is a critical problem in applications such as probabilistic inference and network reliability. For example, it is often used for query evaluation in probabilistic databases. Due to the computational intractability of exact DNF counting, there has been a line of research into a variety of approximation algorithms. These include Monte Carlo approaches such as the classical algorithms of Karp, Luby, and Madras (1989), as well as methods based on hashing (Soos et al. 2023), and heuristic approximations based on Neural Nets (Abboud, Ceylan, and Lukasiewicz 2020).
  We develop a new Monte Carlo approach with an adaptive stopping rule and short-circuit formula evaluation. We prove it achieves Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning bounds and is asymptotically more efficient than the previous methods. We also show experimentally that it out-performs prior algorithms by orders of magnitude, and can scale to much larger problems with millions of variables.

Abstract: The dynamic trees problem is to maintain a tree under edge updates while supporting queries like connectivity queries or path queries. Despite the first data structure for this fundamental problem -- the link-cut tree -- being invented 40 years ago, our experiments reveal that they are still the fastest sequential data structure for the problem. However, link-cut trees cannot support parallel batch-dynamic updates and have limitations on the kinds of queries they support.
  In this paper, we design a new parallel batch-dynamic trees data structure called UFO trees that simultaneously supports a wide range of query functionality, supports work-efficient parallel batch-dynamic updates, and is competitive with link-cut trees when run sequentially. We prove that a key reason for the strong practical performance of both link-cut trees and UFO trees is that they can perform updates and queries in sub-logarithmic time for low-diameter trees. We perform an experimental study of our optimized C++ implementations of UFO trees with ten other dynamic tree implementations, several of which are new, in a broad benchmark of both synthetic and real-world trees of varying diameter and size. Our results show that, in both sequential and parallel settings, UFO trees are the fastest dynamic tree data structure that supports a wide range of queries. Our new implementation of UFO trees has low space usage and easily scales to billion-size inputs, making it a promising building block for implementing more complex dynamic graph algorithms in practice.

Abstract: Since the release of ChatGPT, there has been a lot of debate about whether AI systems pose an existential risk to humanity. This paper develops a general framework for thinking about the existential risk of AI systems. We analyze a two premise argument that AI systems pose a threat to humanity. Premise one: AI systems will become extremely powerful. Premise two: if AI systems become extremely powerful, they will destroy humanity. We use these two premises to construct a taxonomy of survival stories, in which humanity survives into the far future. In each survival story, one of the two premises fails. Either scientific barriers prevent AI systems from becoming extremely powerful; or humanity bans research into AI systems, thereby preventing them from becoming extremely powerful; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because their goals prevent them from doing so; or extremely powerful AI systems do not destroy humanity, because we can reliably detect and disable systems that have the goal of doing so. We argue that different survival stories face different challenges. We also argue that different survival stories motivate different responses to the threats from AI. Finally, we use our taxonomy to produce rough estimates of P(doom), the probability that humanity will be destroyed by AI.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) have driven progress in GUI automation. However, most existing methods rely on static, one-shot visual inputs and passive perception, lacking the ability to adaptively determine when, whether, and how to observe the interface. We present GUI-Eyes, a reinforcement learning framework for active visual perception in GUI tasks. To acquire more informative observations, the agent learns to make strategic decisions on both whether and how to invoke visual tools, such as cropping or zooming, within a two-stage reasoning process. To support this behavior, we introduce a progressive perception strategy that decomposes decision-making into coarse exploration and fine-grained grounding, coordinated by a two-level policy. In addition, we design a spatially continuous reward function tailored to tool usage, which integrates both location proximity and region overlap to provide dense supervision and alleviate the reward sparsity common in GUI environments. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Eyes-3B achieves 44.8% grounding accuracy using only 3k labeled samples, significantly outperforming both supervised and RL-based baselines. These results highlight that tool-aware active perception, enabled by staged policy reasoning and fine-grained reward feedback, is critical for building robust and data-efficient GUI agents.

Abstract: The rapid spread of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about the social reactions they provoke. Prior research documents negative attitudes toward AI users, but it remains unclear whether such disapproval translates into costly action. We address this question in a two-phase online experiment (N = 491 Phase II participants; Phase I provided targets) where participants could spend part of their own endowment to reduce the earnings of peers who had previously completed a real-effort task with or without LLM support. On average, participants destroyed 36% of the earnings of those who relied exclusively on the model, with punishment increasing monotonically with actual LLM use. Disclosure about LLM use created a credibility gap: self-reported null use was punished more harshly than actual null use, suggesting that declarations of "no use" are treated with suspicion. Conversely, at high levels of use, actual reliance on the model was punished more strongly than self-reported reliance. Taken together, these findings provide the first behavioral evidence that the efficiency gains of LLMs come at the cost of social sanctions.

Abstract: Modern logical reasoning with LLMs primarily relies on employing complex interactive frameworks that decompose the reasoning process into subtasks solved through carefully designed prompts or requiring external resources (e.g., symbolic solvers) to exploit their strong logical structures. While interactive approaches introduce additional overhead, hybrid approaches depend on external components, which limit their scalability. A non-interactive, end-to-end framework enables reasoning to emerge within the model itself -- improving generalization while preserving analyzability without any external resources. In this work, we introduce a non-interactive, end-to-end framework for reasoning tasks. We show that introducing structural information into the few-shot prompt activates a subset of attention heads that patterns aligned with logical reasoning operators. Building on this insight, we propose Attention-Aware Intervention (AAI), an inference-time intervention method that reweights attention scores across selected heads identified by their logical patterns. AAI offers an efficient way to steer the model's reasoning toward leveraging prior knowledge through attention modulation. Extensive experiments show that AAI enhances logical reasoning performance across diverse benchmarks and model architectures, while incurring negligible additional computational overhead.

Abstract: Sequential test-time scaling is a promising training-free method to improve large reasoning model accuracy, but as currently implemented, significant limitations have been observed. Inducing models to think for longer can increase their accuracy, but as the length of reasoning is further extended, it has also been shown to result in accuracy degradation and model instability. This work presents a novel sequential test-time scaling method, Min-Seek, which improves model accuracy significantly over a wide range of induced thoughts, stabilizing the accuracy of sequential scaling, and removing the need for reasoning length fine-tuning. Beyond improving model accuracy over a variety of reasoning tasks, our method is inherently efficient, as only the KV pairs of one additional induced thought are kept in the KV cache during reasoning. With a custom KV cache which stores keys without position embeddings, by dynamically encoding them contiguously before each new generated thought, our method can continue to reason well beyond a model's maximum context length, and under mild conditions has linear computational complexity.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Anthropomorphisation -- the phenomenon whereby non-human entities are ascribed human-like qualities -- has become increasingly salient with the rise of large language model (LLM)-based conversational agents (CAs). Unlike earlier chatbots, LLM-based CAs routinely generate interactional and linguistic cues, such as first-person self-reference, epistemic and affective expressions that empirical work shows can increase engagement. On the other hand, anthropomorphisation raises ethical concerns, including deception, overreliance, and exploitative relationship framing, while some authors argue that anthropomorphic interaction may support autonomy, well-being, and inclusion. Despite increasing interest in the phenomenon, literature remains fragmented across domains and varies substantially in how it defines, operationalizes, and normatively evaluates anthropomorphisation. This scoping review maps ethically oriented work on anthropomorphising LLM-based CAs across five databases and three preprint repositories. We synthesize (1) conceptual foundations, (2) ethical challenges and opportunities, and (3) methodological approaches. We find convergence on attribution-based definitions but substantial divergence in operationalization, a predominantly risk-forward normative framing, and limited empirical work that links observed interaction effects to actionable governance guidance. We conclude with a research agenda and design/governance recommendations for ethically deploying anthropomorphic cues in LLM-based conversational agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Human-AI complementarity is the claim that a human supported by an AI system can outperform either alone in a decision-making process. Since its introduction in the human-AI interaction literature, it has gained traction by generalizing the reliance paradigm and by offering a more practical alternative to the contested construct of 'trust in AI.' Yet complementarity faces key theoretical challenges: it lacks precise theoretical anchoring, it is formalized just as a post hoc indicator of relative predictive accuracy, it remains silent about other desiderata of human-AI interactions and it abstracts away from the magnitude-cost profile of its performance gain. As a result, complementarity is difficult to obtain in empirical settings. In this work, we leverage epistemology to address these challenges by reframing complementarity within the discourse on justificatory AI. Drawing on computational reliabilism, we argue that historical instances of complementarity function as evidence that a given human-AI interaction is a reliable epistemic process for a given predictive task. Together with other reliability indicators assessing the alignment of the human-AI team with the epistemic standards and socio-technical practices, complementarity contributes to the degree of reliability of human-AI teams when generating predictions. This supports the practical reasoning of those affected by these outputs -- patients, managers, regulators, and others. In summary, our approach suggests that the role and value of complementarity lies not in providing a relative measure of predictive accuracy, but in helping calibrate decision-making to the reliability of AI-supported processes that increasingly shape everyday life.

Abstract: Most existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) rely on predefined workflows, where human engineers enumerate task states in advance and specify routing rules and contextual injections accordingly. Such workflow-driven designs are essentially rule-based decision trees, which suffer from two fundamental limitations: they require substantial manual effort to anticipate and encode possible task states, and they cannot exhaustively cover the state space of complex real-world tasks. To address these issues, we propose an Information-Flow-Orchestrated Multi-Agent Paradigm via Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication from CORAL, in which a dedicated information flow orchestrator continuously monitors task progress and dynamically coordinates other agents through the A2A toolkit using natural language, without relying on predefined workflows. We evaluate our approach on the general-purpose benchmark GAIA, using the representative workflow-based MAS OWL as the baseline while controlling for agent roles and underlying models. Under the pass@1 setting, our method achieves 63.64% accuracy, outperforming OWL's 55.15% by 8.49 percentage points with comparable token consumption. Further case-level analysis shows that our paradigm enables more flexible task monitoring and more robust handling of edge cases.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become the default strategy for providing large language model (LLM) agents with contextual knowledge. Yet RAG treats memory as a stateless lookup table: information persists indefinitely, retrieval is read-only, and temporal continuity is absent. We define the \textit{Continuum Memory Architecture} (CMA), a class of systems that maintain and update internal state across interactions through persistent storage, selective retention, associative routing, temporal chaining, and consolidation into higher-order abstractions. Rather than disclosing implementation specifics, we specify the architectural requirements CMA imposes and show consistent behavioral advantages on tasks that expose RAG's structural inability to accumulate, mutate, or disambiguate memory. The empirical probes (knowledge updates, temporal association, associative recall, contextual disambiguation) demonstrate that CMA is a necessary architectural primitive for long-horizon agents while highlighting open challenges around latency, drift, and interpretability.

Abstract: AI agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious content hijacks agent behavior to steal credentials or cause financial loss. The only known robust defense is architectural isolation that strictly separates trusted task planning from untrusted environment observations. However, applying this design to Computer Use Agents (CUAs) -- systems that automate tasks by viewing screens and executing actions -- presents a fundamental challenge: current agents require continuous observation of UI state to determine each action, conflicting with the isolation required for security. We resolve this tension by demonstrating that UI workflows, while dynamic, are structurally predictable. We introduce Single-Shot Planning for CUAs, where a trusted planner generates a complete execution graph with conditional branches before any observation of potentially malicious content, providing provable control flow integrity guarantees against arbitrary instruction injections. Although this architectural isolation successfully prevents instruction injections, we show that additional measures are needed to prevent Branch Steering attacks, which manipulate UI elements to trigger unintended valid paths within the plan. We evaluate our design on OSWorld, and retain up to 57% of the performance of frontier models while improving performance for smaller open-source models by up to 19%, demonstrating that rigorous security and utility can coexist in CUAs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) offer transformative potential for high-stakes domains like finance and law, but their tendency to hallucinate, generating factually incorrect or unsupported content, poses a critical reliability risk. This paper introduces a comprehensive operational framework for hallucination management, built on a continuous improvement cycle driven by root cause awareness. We categorize hallucination sources into model, data, and context-related factors, allowing targeted interventions over generic fixes. The framework integrates multi-faceted detection methods (e.g., uncertainty estimation, reasoning consistency) with stratified mitigation strategies (e.g., knowledge grounding, confidence calibration). We demonstrate its application through a tiered architecture and a financial data extraction case study, where model, context, and data tiers form a closed feedback loop for progressive reliability enhancement. This approach provides a systematic, scalable methodology for building trustworthy generative AI systems in regulated environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress in domain-specific applications, particularly within the legal domain. However, general-purpose models such as GPT-4 often struggle with specialized subdomains that require precise legal knowledge, complex reasoning, and contextual sensitivity. To address these limitations, we present LabourLawLLM, a legal large language model tailored to Chinese labor law. We also introduce LabourLawBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering diverse labor-law tasks, including legal provision citation, knowledge-based question answering, case classification, compensation computation, named entity recognition, and legal case analysis. Our evaluation framework combines objective metrics (e.g., ROUGE-L, accuracy, F1, and soft-F1) with subjective assessment based on GPT-4 scoring. Experiments show that LabourLawLLM consistently outperforms general-purpose and existing legal-specific LLMs across task categories. Beyond labor law, our methodology provides a scalable approach for building specialized LLMs in other legal subfields, improving accuracy, reliability, and societal value of legal AI applications.

Abstract: Personalizing Large Language Models typically relies on static retrieval or one-time adaptation, assuming user preferences remain invariant over time. However, real-world interactions are dynamic, where user interests continuously evolve, posing a challenge for models to adapt to preference drift without catastrophic forgetting. Standard continual learning approaches often struggle in this context, as they indiscriminately update on noisy interaction streams, failing to distinguish genuine preference shifts from transient contexts. To address this, we introduce SPRInG, a novel semi-parametric framework designed for effective continual personalization. During training, SPRInG employs drift-driven selective adaptation, which utilizes a likelihood-based scoring function to identify high-novelty interactions. This allows the model to selectively update the user-specific adapter on drift signals while preserving hard-to-learn residuals in a replay buffer. During inference, we apply strict relevance gating and fuse parametric knowledge with retrieved history via logit interpolation. Experiments on the long-form personalized generation benchmark demonstrate that SPRInG outperforms existing baselines, validating its robustness for real-world continual personalization.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Existing NL2SQL systems face two critical limitations: (1) they rely on in-context learning with only correct examples, overlooking the rich signal in historical error-fix pairs that could guide more robust self-correction; and (2) test-time scaling approaches often decompose questions arbitrarily, producing near-identical SQL candidates across runs and diminishing ensemble gains. Moreover, these methods suffer from a stark accuracy-efficiency trade-off: high performance demands excessive computation, while fast variants compromise quality. We present Memo-SQL, a training-free framework that addresses these issues through two simple ideas: structured decomposition and experience-aware self-correction. Instead of leaving decomposition to chance, we apply three clear strategies, entity-wise, hierarchical, and atomic sequential, to encourage diverse reasoning. For correction, we build a dynamic memory of both successful queries and historical error-fix pairs, and use retrieval-augmented prompting to bring relevant examples into context at inference time, no fine-tuning or external APIs required. On BIRD, Memo-SQL achieves 68.5% execution accuracy, setting a new state of the art among open, zero-fine-tuning methods, while using over 10 times fewer resources than prior TTS approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping human-computer interaction (HCI), from personalized assistants to social simulations. Beyond language competence, researchers are exploring whether LLMs can exhibit human-like characteristics that influence engagement, decision-making, and perceived realism. Personality, in particular, is critical, yet existing approaches often struggle to achieve both nuanced and adaptable expression. We present a framework that models LLM personality via Jungian psychological types, integrating three mechanisms: a dominant-auxiliary coordination mechanism for coherent core expression, a reinforcement-compensation mechanism for temporary adaptation to context, and a reflection mechanism that drives long-term personality evolution. This design allows the agent to maintain nuanced traits while dynamically adjusting to interaction demands and gradually updating its underlying structure. Personality alignment is evaluated using Myers-Briggs Type Indicator questionnaires and tested under diverse challenge scenarios as a preliminary structured assessment. Findings suggest that evolving, personality-aware LLMs can support coherent, context-sensitive interactions, enabling naturalistic agent design in HCI.

Abstract: Academic paper search is a fundamental task in scientific research, yet most existing approaches rely on rigid, predefined workflows that struggle with complex, conditional queries. To address this limitation, we propose PaperScout, an autonomous agent that reformulates paper search as a sequential decision-making process. Unlike static workflows, PaperScout dynamically decides whether, when, and how to invoke search and expand tools based on accumulated retrieval context. However, training such agents presents a fundamental challenge: standard reinforcement learning methods, typically designed for single-turn tasks, suffer from a granularity mismatch when applied to multi-turn agentic tasks, where token-level optimization diverges from the granularity of sequence-level interactions, leading to noisy credit assignment. We introduce Proximal Sequence Policy Optimization (PSPO), a process-aware, sequence-level policy optimization method that aligns optimization with agent-environment interaction. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that PaperScout significantly outperforms strong workflow-driven and RL baselines in both recall and relevance, validating the effectiveness of our adaptive agentic framework and optimization strategy.

Abstract: The scientific computation of large deformations in elastic-plastic solids is crucial in various manufacturing applications. Traditional numerical methods exhibit several inherent limitations, prompting Deep Learning (DL) as a promising alternative. The effectiveness of current DL techniques typically depends on the availability of high-quantity and high-accuracy datasets, which are yet difficult to obtain in large deformation problems. During the dataset construction process, a dilemma stands between data quantity and data accuracy, leading to suboptimal performance in the DL models. To address this challenge, we focus on a representative application of large deformations, the stretch bending problem, and propose FilDeep, a Fidelity-based Deep Learning framework for large Deformation of elastic-plastic solids. Our FilDeep aims to resolve the quantity-accuracy dilemma by simultaneously training with both low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, where the former provides greater quantity but lower accuracy, while the latter offers higher accuracy but in less quantity. In FilDeep, we provide meticulous designs for the practical large deformation problem. Particularly, we propose attention-enabled cross-fidelity modules to effectively capture long-range physical interactions across MF data. To the best of our knowledge, our FilDeep presents the first DL framework for large deformation problems using MF data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FilDeep consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance and can be efficiently deployed in manufacturing.

Abstract: The past year has marked a turning point in the evolution and real-world use of large language models (LLMs). With the release of the first widely adopted reasoning model, o1, on December 5th, 2024, the field shifted from single-pass pattern generation to multi-step deliberation inference, accelerating deployment, experimentation, and new classes of applications. As this shift unfolded at a rapid pace, our empirical understanding of how these models have actually been used in practice has lagged behind. In this work, we leverage the OpenRouter platform, which is an AI inference provider across a wide variety of LLMs, to analyze over 100 trillion tokens of real-world LLM interactions across tasks, geographies, and time. In our empirical study, we observe substantial adoption of open-weight models, the outsized popularity of creative roleplay (beyond just the productivity tasks many assume dominate) and coding assistance categories, plus the rise of agentic inference. Furthermore, our retention analysis identifies foundational cohorts: early users whose engagement persists far longer than later cohorts. We term this phenomenon the Cinderella "Glass Slipper" effect. These findings underscore that the way developers and end-users engage with LLMs "in the wild" is complex and multifaceted. We discuss implications for model builders, AI developers, and infrastructure providers, and outline how a data-driven understanding of usage can inform better design and deployment of LLM systems.

Abstract: As knowledge and semantics on the web grow increasingly complex, enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) comprehension and reasoning capabilities has become particularly important. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, it still falls short on logical reasoning tasks that rely on symbolic expressions and strict deductive rules. Neuro-symbolic methods address this gap by enforcing formal correctness through external solvers. Yet these solvers are highly format-sensitive, and small instabilities in model outputs can lead to frequent processing failures. LLM-driven approaches avoid parsing brittleness, but they lack structured representations and process-level error-correction mechanisms. To further enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we propose MatrixCoT, a structured CoT framework with a matrix-based plan. Specifically, we normalize and type natural language expressions, attach explicit citation fields, and introduce a matrix-based planning method to preserve global relations among steps. The plan becomes a verifiable artifact, making execution more stable. For verification, we also add a feedback-driven replanning mechanism. Under semantic-equivalence constraints, it identifies omissions and defects, rewrites and compresses the dependency matrix, and produces a more trustworthy final answer. Experiments on five logical-reasoning benchmarks and five LLMs show that, without relying on external solvers, MatrixCoT enhances both robustness and interpretability when tackling complex symbolic reasoning tasks, while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are challenging to deploy for domain-specific tasks due to their massive scale. While distilling a fine-tuned LLM into a smaller student model is a promising alternative, the capacity gap between teacher and student often leads to suboptimal performance. This raises a key question: when and how can a student model match or even surpass its teacher on domain-specific tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical insight: a student can outperform its teacher if its advantage on a Student-Favored Subdomain (SFS) outweighs its deficit on the Teacher-Favored Subdomain (TFS). Guided by this insight, we propose Scheduled Checkpoint Distillation (SCD), which reduces the TFS deficit by emulating the teacher's convergence process during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the domain task, and a sample-wise Adaptive Weighting (AW) mechanism to preserve student strengths on SFS. Experiments across diverse domain tasks--including QA, NER, and text classification in multiple languages--show that our method consistently outperforms existing distillation approaches, allowing the student model to match or even exceed the performance of its fine-tuned teacher.

Abstract: Privacy policies help inform people about organisations' personal data processing practices, covering different aspects such as data collection, data storage, and sharing of personal data with third parties. Privacy policies are often difficult for people to fully comprehend due to the lengthy and complex legal language used and inconsistent practices across different sectors and organisations. To help conduct automated and large-scale analyses of privacy policies, many researchers have studied applications of machine learning and natural language processing techniques, including large language models (LLMs). While a limited number of prior studies utilised LLMs for extracting personal data flows from privacy policies, our approach builds on this line of work by combining LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and a customised knowledge base derived from existing studies. This paper presents the development of LADFA, an end-to-end computational framework, which can process unstructured text in a given privacy policy, extract personal data flows and construct a personal data flow graph, and conduct analysis of the data flow graph to facilitate insight discovery. The framework consists of a pre-processor, an LLM-based processor, and a data flow post-processor. We demonstrated and validated the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach by conducting a case study that involved examining ten selected privacy policies from the automotive industry. Moreover, it is worth noting that LADFA is designed to be flexible and customisable, making it suitable for a range of text-based analysis tasks beyond privacy policy analysis.

Abstract: Generating molecules that satisfy precise numeric constraints over multiple physicochemical properties is critical and challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) are expressive, they struggle with precise multi-objective control and numeric reasoning without external structure and feedback. We introduce \textbf{M olGen}, a fragment-level, retrieval-augmented, two-stage framework for molecule generation under multi-property constraints. Stage I : Prototype generation: a multi-agent reasoner performs retrieval-anchored, fragment-level edits to produce a candidate near the feasible region. Stage II : RL-based fine-grained optimization: a fragment-level optimizer trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) applies one- or multi-hop refinements to explicitly minimize the property errors toward our target while regulating edit complexity and deviation from the prototype. A large, automatically curated dataset with reasoning chains of fragment edits and measured property deltas underpins both stages, enabling deterministic, reproducible supervision and controllable multi-hop reasoning. Unlike prior work, our framework better reasons about molecules by leveraging fragments and supports controllable refinement toward numeric targets. Experiments on generation under two sets of property constraints (QED, LogP, Molecular Weight and HOMO, LUMO) show consistent gains in validity and precise satisfaction of multi-property targets, outperforming strong LLMs and graph-based algorithms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in reasoning and prediction across different domains. Yet, their ability to infer temporal regularities from structured behavioral data remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic study investigating whether LLMs can predict time intervals between recurring user actions, such as repeated purchases, and how different levels of contextual information shape their predictive behavior. Using a simple but representative repurchase scenario, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs in zero-shot settings against both statistical and machine-learning models. Two key findings emerge. First, while LLMs surpass lightweight statistical baselines, they consistently underperform dedicated machine-learning models, showing their limited ability to capture quantitative temporal structure. Second, although moderate context can improve LLM accuracy, adding further user-level detail degrades performance. These results challenge the assumption that "more context leads to better reasoning". Our study highlights fundamental limitations of today's LLMs in structured temporal inference and offers guidance for designing future context-aware hybrid models that integrate statistical precision with linguistic flexibility.

Abstract: In quantitative finance, the gap between training and real-world performance-driven by concept drift and distributional non-stationarity-remains a critical obstacle for building reliable data-driven systems. Models trained on static historical data often overfit, resulting in poor generalization in dynamic markets. The mantra "History Is Not Enough" underscores the need for adaptive data generation that learns to evolve with the market rather than relying solely on past observations. We present a drift-aware dataflow system that integrates machine learning-based adaptive control into the data curation process. The system couples a parameterized data manipulation module comprising single-stock transformations, multi-stock mix-ups, and curation operations, with an adaptive planner-scheduler that employs gradient-based bi-level optimization to control the system. This design unifies data augmentation, curriculum learning, and data workflow management under a single differentiable framework, enabling provenance-aware replay and continuous data quality monitoring. Extensive experiments on forecasting and reinforcement learning trading tasks demonstrate that our framework enhances model robustness and improves risk-adjusted returns. The system provides a generalizable approach to adaptive data management and learning-guided workflow automation for financial data.

Abstract: Long-sequence decision-making, which is usually addressed through reinforcement learning (RL), is a critical component for optimizing strategic operations in dynamic environments, such as real-time bidding in computational advertising. The Decision Transformer (DT) introduced a powerful paradigm by framing RL as an autoregressive sequence modeling problem. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning and planning tasks. This inspires us whether LLMs, which share the same Transformer foundation, but operate at a much larger scale, can unlock new levels of performance in long-horizon sequential decision-making problem. This work investigates the application of LLMs to offline decision making tasks. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the LLMs' inherent inability to interpret continuous values, as they lack a native understanding of numerical magnitude and order when values are represented as text strings. To address this, we propose treating trajectories as a distinct modality. By learning to align trajectory data with natural language task descriptions, our model can autoregressively predict future decisions within a cohesive framework we term DecisionLLM. We establish a set of scaling laws governing this paradigm, demonstrating that performance hinges on three factors: model scale, data volume, and data quality. In offline experimental benchmarks and bidding scenarios, DecisionLLM achieves strong performance. Specifically, DecisionLLM-3B outperforms the traditional Decision Transformer (DT) by 69.4 on Maze2D umaze-v1 and by 0.085 on AuctionNet. It extends the AIGB paradigm and points to promising directions for future exploration in online bidding.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform medical imaging by automating image analysis and accelerating clinical research. However, research and clinical use are limited by the wide variety of AI implementations and architectures, inconsistent documentation, and reproducibility issues. Here, we introduce MHub.ai, an open-source, container-based platform that standardizes access to AI models with minimal configuration, promoting accessibility and reproducibility in medical imaging. MHub.ai packages models from peer-reviewed publications into standardized containers that support direct processing of DICOM and other formats, provide a unified application interface, and embed structured metadata. Each model is accompanied by publicly available reference data that can be used to confirm model operation. MHub.ai includes an initial set of state-of-the-art segmentation, prediction, and feature extraction models for different modalities. The modular framework enables adaptation of any model and supports community contributions. We demonstrate the utility of the platform in a clinical use case through comparative evaluation of lung segmentation models. To further strengthen transparency and reproducibility, we publicly release the generated segmentations and evaluation metrics and provide interactive dashboards that allow readers to inspect individual cases and reproduce or extend our analysis. By simplifying model use, MHub.ai enables side-by-side benchmarking with identical execution commands and standardized outputs, and lowers the barrier to clinical translation.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely adopted for Protein Representation Learning (PRL), as residue interaction networks can be naturally represented as graphs. Current GNN-based PRL methods typically rely on single-perspective graph construction strategies, which capture partial properties of residue interactions, resulting in incomplete protein representations. To address this limitation, we propose MMPG, a framework that constructs protein graphs from multiple perspectives and adaptively fuses them via Mixture of Experts (MoE) for PRL. MMPG constructs graphs from physical, chemical, and geometric perspectives to characterize different properties of residue interactions. To capture both perspective-specific features and their synergies, we develop an MoE module, which dynamically routes perspectives to specialized experts, where experts learn intrinsic features and cross-perspective interactions. We quantitatively verify that MoE automatically specializes experts in modeling distinct levels of interaction from individual representations, to pairwise inter-perspective synergies, and ultimately to a global consensus across all perspectives. Through integrating this multi-level information, MMPG produces superior protein representations and achieves advanced performance on four different downstream protein tasks.

Abstract: Compositionality is a cognitive mechanism that allows humans to systematically combine known concepts in novel ways. This study demonstrates how artificial neural agents acquire and utilize compositional generalization to describe previously unseen images. Our method, termed "Composition through Decomposition", involves two sequential training steps. In the 'Decompose' step, the agents learn to decompose an image into basic concepts using a codebook acquired during interaction in a multi-target coordination game. Subsequently, in the 'Compose' step, the agents employ this codebook to describe novel images by composing basic concepts into complex phrases. Remarkably, we observe cases where generalization in the `Compose' step is achieved zero-shot, without the need for additional training.

Abstract: Automated analysis of needle electromyography (nEMG) signals is emerging as a tool to support the detection of neuromuscular diseases (NMDs), yet the signals' high and heterogeneous sampling rates pose substantial computational challenges for feature-based machine-learning models, particularly for near real-time analysis. Downsampling offers a potential solution, but its impact on diagnostic signal content and classification performance remains insufficiently understood. This study presents a workflow for systematically evaluating information loss caused by downsampling in high-frequency time series. The workflow combines shape-based distortion metrics with classification outcomes from available feature-based machine learning models and feature space analysis to quantify how different downsampling algorithms and factors affect both waveform integrity and predictive performance. We use a three-class NMD classification task to experimentally evaluate the workflow. We demonstrate how the workflow identifies downsampling configurations that preserve diagnostic information while substantially reducing computational load. Analysis of shape-based distortion metrics showed that shape-aware downsampling algorithms outperform standard decimation, as they better preserve peak structure and overall signal morphology. The results provide practical guidance for selecting downsampling configurations that enable near real-time nEMG analysis and highlight a generalisable workflow that can be used to balance data reduction with model performance in other high-frequency time-series applications as well.

Abstract: Group anomaly detection is crucial in many network applications, but faces challenges due to diverse anomaly patterns. Motivated by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, graph foundation models (GFMs) is proposed to handle few-shot learning task with fewer labeling efforts. GFMs have been successfully applied to detection of individual anomalies but cannot be generalized to group anomalies, as group anomaly patterns must be detected as a whole and individuals in an abnormal group can look rather normal. Therefore, we propose GFM4GA, a novel graph foundation model for group anomaly detection. The pipeline is pretrained via dual-level contrastive learning based on feature-based estimation and group extraction, to capture potential group anomaly structure and feature inconsistencies. In the downstream tasks, the pipeline is finetuned in parameter-constrained and group-anomaly-proportion weighted few-shot settings, and its adaptive ability to unseen group anomalies expanded via group contexts determined by labeled anomaly neighbors. Experiments show that GFM4GA surpasses group anomaly detectors and GFMs for individual anomalies, achieving average improvements of 2.85% in AUROC and 2.55% in AUPRC.

Abstract: In enterprise datasets, documents are rarely pure. They are not just text, nor just numbers; they are a complex amalgam of narrative and structure. Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have attempted to address this complexity with a blunt tool: linearization. We convert rich, multidimensional tables into simple Markdown-style text strings, hoping that an embedding model will capture the geometry of a spreadsheet in a single vector. But it has already been shown that this is mathematically insufficient.
  This work presents Topo-RAG, a framework that challenges the assumption that "everything is text". We propose a dual architecture that respects the topology of the data: we route fluid narrative through traditional dense retrievers, while tabular structures are processed by a Cell-Aware Late Interaction mechanism, preserving their spatial relationships. Evaluated on SEC-25, a synthetic enterprise corpus that mimics real-world complexity, Topo-RAG demonstrates an 18.4% improvement in nDCG@10 on hybrid queries compared to standard linearization approaches. It's not just about searching better; it's about understanding the shape of information.

Abstract: Multi-step reasoning tasks like mathematical problem solving are vulnerable to cascading failures, where a single incorrect step leads to complete solution breakdown. Current LLM routing methods assign entire queries to one model, treating all reasoning steps as equal. We propose TRIM (Targeted routing in multi-step reasoning tasks), which routes only critical steps$\unicode{x2013}$those likely to derail the solution$\unicode{x2013}$to larger models while letting smaller models handle routine continuations. Our key insight is that targeted step-level interventions can fundamentally transform inference efficiency by confining expensive calls to precisely those steps where stronger models prevent cascading errors. TRIM operates at the step-level: it uses process reward models to identify erroneous steps and makes routing decisions based on step-level uncertainty and budget constraints. We develop several routing strategies within TRIM, ranging from a simple threshold-based policy to more expressive policies that reason about long-horizon accuracy-cost trade-offs and uncertainty in step-level correctness estimates. On MATH-500, even the simplest thresholding strategy surpasses prior routing methods with 5x higher cost efficiency, while more advanced policies match the strong, expensive model's performance using 80% fewer expensive model tokens. On harder benchmarks such as AIME, TRIM achieves up to 6x higher cost efficiency. All methods generalize effectively across math reasoning tasks, demonstrating that step-level difficulty represents fundamental characteristics of reasoning.

Abstract: We present NoReGeo, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the intrinsic geometric understanding of large language models (LLMs) without relying on reasoning or algebraic computation. Unlike existing benchmarks that primarily assess models' proficiency in reasoning-based geometry-where solutions are derived using algebraic methods-NoReGeo focuses on evaluating whether LLMs can inherently encode spatial relationships and recognize geometric properties directly. Our benchmark comprises 2,500 trivial geometric problems spanning 25 categories, each carefully crafted to be solvable purely through native geometric understanding, assuming known object locations. We assess a range of state-of-the-art models on NoReGeo, including frontier models like GPT-4, observing that even the most advanced systems achieve an overall maximum of 65% accuracy in binary classification tasks. Further, our ablation experiments demonstrate that such geometric understanding does not emerge through fine-tuning alone, indicating that effective training for geometric comprehension requires a specialized approach from the outset. Our findings highlight a significant gap in current LLMs' ability to natively grasp geometric concepts, providing a foundation for future research toward models with true geometric cognition.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has advanced LLM reasoning, applying it to long-context scenarios is hindered by sparsity of outcome rewards. This limitation fails to penalize ungrounded "lucky guesses," leaving the critical process of needle-in-a-haystack evidence retrieval largely unsupervised. To address this, we propose EAPO (Evidence-Augmented Policy Optimization). We first establish the Evidence-Augmented Reasoning paradigm, validating via Tree-Structured Evidence Sampling that precise evidence extraction is the decisive bottleneck for long-context reasoning. Guided by this insight, EAPO introduces a specialized RL algorithm where a reward model computes a Group-Relative Evidence Reward, providing dense process supervision to explicitly improve evidence quality. To sustain accurate supervision throughout training, we further incorporate an Adaptive Reward-Policy Co-Evolution mechanism. This mechanism iteratively refines the reward model using outcome-consistent rollouts, sharpening its discriminative capability to ensure precise process guidance. Comprehensive evaluations across eight benchmarks demonstrate that EAPO significantly enhances long-context reasoning performance compared to SOTA baselines.

Abstract: Heart rate variability (HRV) is a pivotal noninvasive marker for autonomic monitoring; however, applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to HRV interpretation is hindered by physiological hallucinations. These include respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) contamination, short-data instability in nonlinear metrics, and the neglect of individualized baselines in favor of population norms. We propose C-GRASP (Clinically-Grounded Reasoning for Affective Signal Processing), a guardrailed RAG-enhanced pipeline that decomposes HRV interpretation into eight traceable reasoning steps. Central to C-GRASP is a Z-score Priority Hierarchy that enforces the weighting of individualized baseline shifts over normative statistics. The system effectively mitigates spectral hallucinations through automated RSA-aware guardrails, preventing contamination of frequency-domain indices. Evaluated on 414 trials from the DREAMER dataset, C-GRASP integrated with high-scale reasoning models (e.g., MedGemma3-thinking) achieved superior performance in 4-class emotion classification (37.3% accuracy) and a Clinical Reasoning Consistency (CRC) score of 69.6%. Ablation studies confirm that the individualized Delta Z-score module serves as the critical logical anchor, preventing the "population bias" common in native LLMs. Ultimately, C-GRASP transitions affective computing from black-box classification to transparent, evidence-based clinical decision support, paving the way for safer AI integration in biomedical engineering.

Abstract: In LLM-based text-to-SQL systems, unanswerable and underspecified user queries may generate not only incorrect text but also executable programs that yield misleading results or violate safety constraints, posing a major barrier to safe deployment. Existing refusal strategies for such queries either rely on output-level instruction following, which is brittle due to model hallucinations, or estimate output uncertainty, which adds complexity and overhead. To address this challenge, we formalize safe refusal in text-to-SQL systems as an answerability-gating problem and propose LatentRefusal, a latent-signal refusal mechanism that predicts query answerability from intermediate hidden activations of a large language model. We introduce the Tri-Residual Gated Encoder, a lightweight probing architecture, to suppress schema noise and amplify sparse, localized cues of question-schema mismatch that indicate unanswerability. Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse ambiguous and unanswerable settings, together with ablation studies and interpretability analyses, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and show that LatentRefusal provides an attachable and efficient safety layer for text-to-SQL systems. Across four benchmarks, LatentRefusal improves average F1 to 88.5 percent on both backbones while adding approximately 2 milliseconds of probe overhead.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence toward agentic science is currently bottlenecked by the challenge of ultra-long-horizon autonomy, the ability to sustain strategic coherence and iterative correction over experimental cycles spanning days or weeks. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated prowess in short-horizon reasoning, they are easily overwhelmed by execution details in the high-dimensional, delayed-feedback environments of real-world research, failing to consolidate sparse feedback into coherent long-term guidance. Here, we present ML-Master 2.0, an autonomous agent that masters ultra-long-horizon machine learning engineering (MLE) which is a representative microcosm of scientific discovery. By reframing context management as a process of cognitive accumulation, our approach introduces Hierarchical Cognitive Caching (HCC), a multi-tiered architecture inspired by computer systems that enables the structural differentiation of experience over time. By dynamically distilling transient execution traces into stable knowledge and cross-task wisdom, HCC allows agents to decouple immediate execution from long-term experimental strategy, effectively overcoming the scaling limits of static context windows. In evaluations on OpenAI's MLE-Bench under 24-hour budgets, ML-Master 2.0 achieves a state-of-the-art medal rate of 56.44%. Our findings demonstrate that ultra-long-horizon autonomy provides a scalable blueprint for AI capable of autonomous exploration beyond human-precedent complexities.

Abstract: Automatic Question Generation (QG) often produces outputs with critical defects, such as factual hallucinations and answer mismatches. However, existing evaluation methods, including LLM-based evaluators, mainly adopt a black-box and holistic paradigm without explicit error modeling, leading to the neglect of such defects and overestimation of question quality. To address this issue, we propose ErrEval, a flexible and Error-aware Evaluation framework that enhances QG evaluation through explicit error diagnostics. Specifically, ErrEval reformulates evaluation as a two-stage process of error diagnosis followed by informed scoring. At the first stage, a lightweight plug-and-play Error Identifier detects and categorizes common errors across structural, linguistic, and content-related aspects. These diagnostic signals are then incorporated as explicit evidence to guide LLM evaluators toward more fine-grained and grounded judgments. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ErrEval, showing that incorporating explicit diagnostics improves alignment with human judgments. Further analyses confirm that ErrEval effectively mitigates the overestimation of low-quality questions.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is critical, yet traditional fine-tuning methods are computationally expensive and inflexible. While test-time alignment offers a promising alternative, existing approaches often rely on distorted trajectory-level signals or inefficient sampling, fundamentally capping performance and failing to preserve the generative diversity of the base model. This paper introduces LLMdoctor, a novel framework for efficient test-time alignment that operates via a patient-doctor paradigm. It integrates token-level reward acquisition with token-level flow-guided preference optimization (TFPO) to steer a large, frozen patient LLM with a smaller, specialized doctor model. Unlike conventional methods that rely on trajectory-level rewards, LLMdoctor first extracts fine-grained, token-level preference signals from the patient model's behavioral variations. These signals then guide the training of the doctor model via TFPO, which establishes flow consistency across all subtrajectories, enabling precise token-by-token alignment while inherently preserving generation diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLMdoctor significantly outperforms existing test-time alignment methods and even surpasses the performance of full fine-tuning approaches like DPO.

Abstract: Although the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) dominate industrial tabular applications, upgrading legacy models in high-concurrency production environments still faces prohibitive retraining costs and systemic risks. To address this problem, we present NSR-Boost, a neuro-symbolic residual boosting framework designed specifically for industrial scenarios. Its core advantage lies in being "non-intrusive". It treats the legacy model as a frozen model and performs targeted repairs on "hard regions" where predictions fail. The framework comprises three key stages: first, finding hard regions through residuals, then generating interpretable experts by generating symbolic code structures using Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning parameters using Bayesian optimization, and finally dynamically integrating experts with legacy model output through a lightweight aggregator. We report on the successful deployment of NSR-Boost within the core financial risk control system at Qfin Holdings. This framework not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines across six public datasets and one private dataset, more importantly, shows excellent performance gains on real-world online data. In conclusion, it effectively captures long-tail risks missed by traditional models and offers a safe, low-cost evolutionary paradigm for industry.

Abstract: With advancements in deep learning (DL) and computer vision techniques, the field of chart understanding is evolving rapidly. In particular, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are proving to be efficient and accurate in understanding charts. To accurately measure the performance of MLLMs, the research community has developed multiple datasets to serve as benchmarks. By examining these datasets, we found that they are all limited to a small set of chart types. To bridge this gap, we propose the ChartComplete dataset. The dataset is based on a chart taxonomy borrowed from the visualization community, and it covers thirty different chart types. The dataset is a collection of classified chart images and does not include a learning signal. We present the ChartComplete dataset as is to the community to build upon it.

Abstract: Domain-specific knowledge graphs (DKGs) often lack coverage compared to general knowledge graphs (GKGs). To address this, we introduce Domain-specific Knowledge Graph Fusion (DKGF), a novel task that enriches DKGs by integrating relevant facts from GKGs. DKGF faces two key challenges: high ambiguity in domain relevance and misalignment in knowledge granularity across graphs. We propose ExeFuse, a simple yet effective Fact-as-Program paradigm. It treats each GKG fact as a latent semantic program, maps abstract relations to granularity-aware operators, and verifies domain relevance via program executability on the target DKG. This unified probabilistic framework jointly resolves relevance and granularity issues. We construct two benchmarks, DKGF(W-I) and DKGF(Y-I), with 21 evaluation configurations. Extensive experiments validate the task's importance and our model's effectiveness, providing the first standardized testbed for DKGF.

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, widely deployed in consequential contexts, and efficacious in bringing about real-world impacts, ensuring that their decisions are not only instrumentally effective but also normatively aligned has become critical. We introduce a neuro-symbolic reason-based containment architecture, Governor for Reason-Aligned ContainmEnt (GRACE), that decouples normative reasoning from instrumental decision-making and can contain AI agents of virtually any design. GRACE restructures decision-making into three modules: a Moral Module (MM) that determines permissible macro actions via deontic logic-based reasoning; a Decision-Making Module (DMM) that encapsulates the target agent while selecting instrumentally optimal primitive actions in accordance with derived macro actions; and a Guard that monitors and enforces moral compliance. The MM uses a reason-based formalism providing a semantic foundation for deontic logic, enabling interpretability, contestability, and justifiability. Its symbolic representation enriches the DMM's informational context and supports formal verification and statistical guarantees of alignment enforced by the Guard. We demonstrate GRACE on an example of a LLM therapy assistant, showing how it enables stakeholders to understand, contest, and refine agent behavior.

Abstract: The practice of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has achieved state-of-the-art performance on specialized tasks, yet diagnosing why these models become brittle and fail to generalize remains a critical open problem. To address this, we introduce and apply a multi-layered diagnostic framework to a cross-architectural study. We fine-tune Llama 3.1 8B, Gemma 2 9B, and Mistral models on a high-stakes phishing detection task and use SHAP analysis and mechanistic interpretability to uncover the root causes of their generalization failures. Our investigation reveals three critical findings: (1) Generalization is driven by a powerful synergy between architecture and data diversity. The Gemma 2 9B model achieves state-of-the-art performance (>91\% F1), but only when trained on a stylistically diverse ``generalist'' dataset. (2) Generalization is highly architecture-dependent. We diagnose a specific failure mode in Llama 3.1 8B, which performs well on a narrow domain but cannot integrate diverse data, leading to a significant performance drop. (3) Some architectures are inherently more generalizable. The Mistral model proves to be a consistent and resilient performer across multiple training paradigms. By pinpointing the flawed heuristics responsible for these failures, our work provides a concrete methodology for diagnosing and understanding generalization failures, underscoring that reliable AI requires deep validation of the interplay between architecture, data, and training strategy.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has produced substantial gains in reasoning, perception, and generative capability across language and vision. However, whether these advances yield commensurate improvements in safety remains unclear, in part due to fragmented evaluation practices limited to single modalities or threat models. In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of 7 frontier models: GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Doubao 1.8, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5. We evaluate each model across language, vision-language, and image generation settings using a unified protocol that integrates benchmark evaluation, adversarial evaluation, multilingual evaluation, and compliance evaluation. Aggregating our evaluations into safety leaderboards and model safety profiles across multiple evaluation modes reveals a sharply heterogeneous safety landscape. While GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced safety performance across evaluations, other models exhibit pronounced trade-offs among benchmark safety, adversarial alignment, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Both language and vision-language modalities show significant vulnerability under adversarial evaluation, with all models degrading substantially despite strong results on standard benchmarks. Text-to-image models achieve relatively stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain brittle under adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these results show that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation scheme, underscoring the need for standardized safety evaluations to accurately assess real-world risk and guide responsible model development and deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language tasks and are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. Despite extensive safety alignment efforts, recent studies show that such alignment is often shallow and remains vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Existing defense mechanisms, including decoding-based constraints and post-hoc content detectors, struggle against sophisticated jailbreaks, often intervening robust detection or excessively degrading model utility. In this work, we examine the decoding process of LLMs and make a key observation: even when successfully jailbroken, models internally exhibit latent safety-related signals during generation. However, these signals are overridden by the model's drive for fluent continuation, preventing timely self-correction or refusal. Building on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective approach that explicitly surfaces and leverages these latent safety signals for early detection of unsafe content during decoding. Experiments across diverse jailbreak attacks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances safety, while maintaining low over-refusal rates on benign inputs and preserving response quality. Our results suggest that activating intrinsic safety-awareness during decoding offers a promising and complementary direction for defending against jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: In this article, we argue that understanding the collective behavior of agents based on large language models (LLMs) is an essential area of inquiry, with important implications in terms of risks and benefits, impacting us as a society at many levels. We claim that the distinctive nature of LLMs--namely, their initialization with extensive pre-trained knowledge and implicit social priors, together with their capability of adaptation through in-context learning--motivates the need for an interactionist paradigm consisting of alternative theoretical foundations, methodologies, and analytical tools, in order to systematically examine how prior knowledge and embedded values interact with social context to shape emergent phenomena in multi-agent generative AI systems. We propose and discuss four directions that we consider crucial for the development and deployment of LLM-based collectives, focusing on theory, methods, and trans-disciplinary dialogue.

Abstract: Comprehending genomic information is essential for biomedical research, yet extracting data from complex distributed databases remains challenging.

We replicate GeneGPT and propose GenomAgent, a multi-agent framework that efficiently coordinates specialized agents for complex genomics queries. Evaluated on nine tasks from the GeneTuring benchmark, GenomAgent outperforms GeneGPT by 12% on average, and its flexible architecture extends beyond genomics to various scientific domains needing expert knowledge extraction.

Our approach substantially outperforms enumeration-based baselines, with speedups of up to two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Hierarchical reasoning model (HRM) achieves extraordinary performance on various reasoning tasks, significantly outperforming large language model-based reasoners. To understand the strengths and potential failure modes of HRM, we conduct a mechanistic study on its reasoning patterns and find three surprising facts: (a) Failure of extremely simple puzzles, e.g., HRM can fail on a puzzle with only one unknown cell. We attribute this failure to the violation of the fixed point property, a fundamental assumption of HRM. (b) "Grokking" dynamics in reasoning steps, i.e., the answer is not improved uniformly, but instead there is a critical reasoning step that suddenly makes the answer correct; (c) Existence of multiple fixed points. HRM "guesses" the first fixed point, which could be incorrect, and gets trapped there for a while or forever. All facts imply that HRM appears to be "guessing" instead of "reasoning". Leveraging this "guessing" picture, we propose three strategies to scale HRM's guesses: data augmentation (scaling the quality of guesses), input perturbation (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging inference randomness), and model bootstrapping (scaling the number of guesses by leveraging training randomness). On the practical side, by combining all methods, we develop Augmented HRM, boosting accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme from 54.5% to 96.9%. On the scientific side, our analysis provides new insights into how reasoning models "reason".

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) contexts are typically constructed using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which involves ranking and selecting the top-k passages. The approach causes fragmentation in information graphs in document structures, over-retrieval, and duplication of content alongside insufficient query context, including 2nd and 3rd order facets. In this paper, a structure-informed and diversity-constrained context bubble construction framework is proposed that assembles coherent, citable bundles of spans under a strict token budget. The method preserves and exploits inherent document structure by organising multi-granular spans (e.g., sections and rows) and using task-conditioned structural priors to guide retrieval. Starting from high-relevance anchor spans, a context bubble is constructed through constrained selection that balances query relevance, marginal coverage, and redundancy penalties. It will explicitly constrain diversity and budget, producing compact and informative context sets, unlike top-k retrieval. Moreover, a full retrieval is emitted that traces the scoring and selection choices of the records, thus providing auditability and deterministic tuning. Experiments on enterprise documents demonstrate the efficiency of context bubble as it significantly reduces redundant context, is better able to cover secondary facets and has a better answer quality and citation faithfulness within a limited context window. Ablation studies demonstrate that both structural priors as well as diversity constraint selection are necessary; removing either component results in a decline in coverage and an increase in redundant or incomplete context.

Abstract: Our study examines how generative AI (GenAI) influences performance, creative self-efficacy, and cognitive load in architectural conceptual design tasks. Thirty-six student participants from Architectural Engineering and other disciplines completed a two-phase architectural design task, first independently and then with external tools (GenAI-assisted condition and control condition using an online repository of existing architectural projects). Design outcomes were evaluated by expert raters, while self-efficacy and cognitive load were self-reported after each phase. Difference-in-differences analyses revealed no overall performance advantage of GenAI across participants; however, subgroup analyses showed that GenAI significantly improved design performance for novice designers. In contrast, general creative self-efficacy declined for students using GenAI. Cognitive load did not differ significantly between conditions, though prompt usage patterns showed that iterative idea generation and visual feedback prompts were linked to greater reductions in cognitive load. These findings suggest that GenAI effectiveness depends on users' prior expertise and interaction strategies through prompting.

Abstract: We consider sampling from a Gibbs distribution by evolving a finite number of particles using a particular score estimator rather than Brownian motion. To accelerate the particles, we consider a second-order score-based ODE, similar to Nesterov acceleration. In contrast to traditional kernel density score estimation, we use the recently proposed regularized Wasserstein proximal method, yielding the Accelerated Regularized Wasserstein Proximal method (ARWP). We provide a detailed analysis of continuous- and discrete-time non-asymptotic and asymptotic mixing rates for Gaussian initial and target distributions, using techniques from Euclidean acceleration and accelerated information gradients. Compared with the kinetic Langevin sampling algorithm, the proposed algorithm exhibits a higher contraction rate in the asymptotic time regime. Numerical experiments are conducted across various low-dimensional experiments, including multi-modal Gaussian mixtures and ill-conditioned Rosenbrock distributions. ARWP exhibits structured and convergent particles, accelerated discrete-time mixing, and faster tail exploration than the non-accelerated regularized Wasserstein proximal method and kinetic Langevin methods. Additionally, ARWP particles exhibit better generalization properties for some non-log-concave Bayesian neural network tasks.

Abstract: Directed acyclic graphical (DAG) models are a powerful tool for representing causal relationships among jointly distributed random variables, especially concerning data from across different experimental settings. However, it is not always practical or desirable to estimate a causal model at the granularity of given features in a particular dataset. There is a growing body of research on causal abstraction to address such problems. We contribute to this line of research by (i) providing novel graphical identifiability results for practically-relevant interventional settings, (ii) proposing an efficient, provably consistent algorithm for directly learning abstract causal graphs from interventional data with unknown intervention targets, and (iii) uncovering theoretical insights about the lattice structure of the underlying search space, with connections to the field of causal discovery more generally. As proof of concept, we apply our algorithm on synthetic and real datasets with known ground truths, including measurements from a controlled physical system with interacting light intensity and polarization.

Abstract: We study potential presence of statistical-computational gaps (SCG) in symmetric binary perceptrons (SBP) via a parametric utilization of \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl-RDT) [96]. A structural change from decreasingly to arbitrarily ordered $c$-sequence (a key fl-RDT parametric component) is observed on the second lifting level and associated with \emph{satisfiability} ($α_c$) -- \emph{algorithmic} ($α_a$) constraints density threshold change thereby suggesting a potential existence of a nonzero computational gap $SCG=α_c-α_a$. The second level estimate is shown to match the theoretical $α_c$ whereas the $r\rightarrow \infty$ level one is proposed to correspond to $α_a$. For example, for the canonical SBP ($κ=1$ margin) we obtain $α_c\approx 1.8159$ on the second and $α_a\approx 1.6021$ (with converging tendency towards $\sim 1.59$ range) on the seventh level. Our propositions remarkably well concur with recent literature: (i) in [20] local entropy replica approach predicts $α_{LE}\approx 1.58$ as the onset of clustering defragmentation (presumed driving force behind locally improving algorithms failures); (ii) in $α\rightarrow 0$ regime we obtain on the third lifting level $κ\approx 1.2385\sqrt{\frac{α_a}{-\log\left ( α_a \right ) }}$ which qualitatively matches overlap gap property (OGP) based predictions of [43] and identically matches local entropy based predictions of [24]; (iii) $c$-sequence ordering change phenomenology mirrors the one observed in asymmetric binary perceptron (ABP) in [98] and the negative Hopfield model in [100]; and (iv) as in [98,100], we here design a CLuP based algorithm whose practical performance closely matches proposed theoretical predictions.
