Existing tool-augmented hallucination detection methods\nrequire pre-defined fixed verification strategies, which are crucial to the\nquality and effectiveness of tool calls. Some methods directly employ powerful\nclosed-source LLMs such as GPT-4 as detectors, which are effective but too\ncostly. To mitigate the cost issue, some methods adopt the teacher-student\narchitecture and finetune open-source small models as detectors via agent\ntuning. However, these methods are limited by fixed strategies. When faced with\na dynamically changing execution environment, they may lack adaptability and\ninappropriately call tools, ultimately leading to detection failure. To address\nthe problem of insufficient strategy adaptability, we propose the innovative\n``Learning to Evaluate and Adaptively Plan''(LEAP) framework, which endows an\nefficient student model with the dynamic learning and proactive correction\ncapabilities of the teacher model. Specifically, our method formulates the\nhallucination detection problem as a dynamic strategy learning problem. We\nfirst employ a teacher model to generate trajectories within the dynamic\nlearning loop and dynamically adjust the strategy based on execution failures.\nWe then distill this dynamic planning capability into an efficient student\nmodel via agent tuning. Finally, during strategy execution, the student model\nadopts a proactive correction mechanism, enabling it to propose, review, and\noptimize its own verification strategies before execution. We demonstrate\nthrough experiments on three challenging benchmarks that our LEAP-tuned model\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."}

A switch with\n$n$ output ports receives a stream of incoming packets. When an incoming packet\nis accepted by the switch, it is stored in a shared buffer of capacity $B$\ncommon to all packets and awaits its transmission through its corresponding\noutput port determined by its destination. Each output port transmits one\npacket per time unit. The problem is to find an algorithm for the switch to\naccept or reject a packet upon its arrival in order to maximize the total\nnumber of transmitted packets.\n  Building on the work of Kesselman et al.

In their work, they\npresented the Harmonic policy and proved that it is $(2 + \\ln n)$-competitive,\nwhich is the best known competitive ratio for this problem.

With its\npotential to serve as a critical attack vector, the ever-decreasing RH\nthreshold now threatens DRAM process technology scaling, with a superlinearly\nincreasing cost of RH protection solutions. Due to their generality and\nrelatively lower performance costs, architectural RH solutions are the first\nline of defense against RH. However, the field is fragmented with varying views\nof the problem, terminologies, and even threat models.\n  In this paper, we systematize architectural RH defenses from the last decade\nthrough the lens of streaming algorithms. We provide a taxonomy that\nencompasses 48 different works. We map multiple architectural RH defenses to\nthe classical streaming algorithms, which extends to multiple proposals that\ndid not identify this link. We also provide two practitioner guides. The first\nguide analyzes which algorithm best fits a given RHTH, location, process\ntechnology, storage type, and mitigative action. The second guide encourages\nfuture research to consult existing algorithms when architecting RH defenses.\nWe illustrate this by demonstrating how Reservoir-Sampling can improve related\nRH defenses, and also introduce StickySampling that can provide mathematical\nsecurity that related studies do not guarantee."}

Applied to Bangla-language news data, ALIGN\ndemonstrates consistent improvements over traditional geoparsing methods,\naccurately identifying district and sub-district-level crash sites. Beyond its\ntechnical contribution, the framework establishes a high accuracy foundation\nfor automated crash mapping in data-scarce regions, supporting evidence-driven\nroad-safety policymaking and the broader integration of multimodal artificial\nintelligence in transportation analytics.

Validated across six\nmembranes under industrially relevant conditions (0.05-5.0 A/cm$^2$, 1-200 bar,\n25-85{\\deg}C), our PINN achieves exceptional accuracy (R$^2$ = 99.84%, RMSE =\n0.0348%) with sub-millisecond inference times suitable for real-time control.\nRemarkably, the model maintains R$^2$ > 86% when predicting crossover at\npressures 2.5x beyond training range-substantially outperforming pure neural\nnetworks (R$^2$ = 43.4%). The hardware-agnostic deployment, from desktop CPUs\nto edge devices (Raspberry Pi 4), enables distributed safety monitoring\nessential for gigawatt-scale installations. By bridging physical rigor and\ncomputational efficiency, this work establishes a new paradigm for real-time\nelectrolyzer monitoring, accelerating deployment of safe, efficient green\nhydrogen infrastructure crucial for net-zero emissions targets."}

(2) Proposing an Asymmetric Decoder\nDistillation approach allowing us to replace the native codec-latent-VAE\ndecoder with a more efficient one, without disturbing the generative\nlatent-space of the generation pipeline. (3) Pruning of MMDiT blocks within the\ndenoiser backbone based on their relative importance, with recovery of original\nperformance through a two-stage distillation process. (4) Reducing the NFE\n(Neural Functional Evaluation) requirement of the denoiser by performing step\ndistillation using DMD adapted for pyramidal flow-matching, thereby\nsubstantially accelerating video generation. When paired with an optimised\nSSD1B first-frame image generator and QuickSRNet for 2x super-resolution, our\nend-to-end Neodragon system becomes a highly parameter (4.945B full model),\nmemory (3.5GB peak RAM usage), and runtime (6.7s E2E latency) efficient\nmobile-friendly model, while achieving a VBench total score of 81.61. By\nenabling low-cost, private, and on-device text-to-video synthesis, Neodragon\ndemocratizes AI-based video content creation, empowering creators to generate\nhigh-quality videos without reliance on cloud services.

However,\napplying PTM-based OCL approaches to sensor-based HAR poses significant\nchallenges due to the inherent heterogeneity of HAR datasets and the scarcity\nof labeled data in post-deployment scenarios. This paper introduces PTRN-HAR,\nthe first successful application of PTM-based OCL to sensor-based HAR. Unlike\nprior PTM-based OCL approaches, PTRN-HAR pre-trains the feature extractor using\ncontrastive loss with a limited amount of data. This extractor is then frozen\nduring the streaming stage. Furthermore, it replaces the conventional dense\nclassification layer with a relation module network. Our design not only\nsignificantly reduces the resource consumption required for model training\nwhile maintaining high performance, but also improves data efficiency by\nreducing the amount of labeled data needed for effective continual learning, as\ndemonstrated through experiments on three public datasets, outperforming the\nstate-of-the-art.

In contrast, simpler LLM applications, such as customer service\nchatbots, are widespread on the web, yet their security posture and exposure to\nsuch attacks remain poorly understood. These applications often rely on\nthird-party chatbot plugins that act as intermediaries to commercial LLM APIs,\noffering non-expert website builders intuitive ways to customize chatbot\nbehaviors. To bridge this gap, we present the first large-scale study of 17\nthird-party chatbot plugins used by over 10,000 public websites, uncovering\npreviously unknown prompt injection risks in practice. First, 8 of these\nplugins (used by 8,000 websites) fail to enforce the integrity of the\nconversation history transmitted in network requests between the website\nvisitor and the chatbot. This oversight amplifies the impact of direct prompt\ninjection attacks by allowing adversaries to forge conversation histories\n(including fake system messages), boosting their ability to elicit unintended\nbehavior (e.g., code generation) by 3 to 8x. Second, 15 plugins offer tools,\nsuch as web-scraping, to enrich the chatbot's context with website-specific\ncontent. However, these tools do not distinguish the website's trusted content\n(e.g., product descriptions) from untrusted, third-party content (e.g.,\ncustomer reviews), introducing a risk of indirect prompt injection. Notably, we\nfound that ~13% of e-commerce websites have already exposed their chatbots to\nthird-party content. We systematically evaluate both vulnerabilities through\ncontrolled experiments grounded in real-world observations, focusing on factors\nsuch as system prompt design and the underlying LLM.

Validated across six\nmembranes under industrially relevant conditions (0.05-5.0 A/cm$^2$, 1-200 bar,\n25-85{\\deg}C), our PINN achieves exceptional accuracy (R$^2$ = 99.84%, RMSE =\n0.0348%) with sub-millisecond inference times suitable for real-time control.\nRemarkably, the model maintains R$^2$ > 86% when predicting crossover at\npressures 2.5x beyond training range-substantially outperforming pure neural\nnetworks (R$^2$ = 43.4%). The hardware-agnostic deployment, from desktop CPUs\nto edge devices (Raspberry Pi 4), enables distributed safety monitoring\nessential for gigawatt-scale installations. By bridging physical rigor and\ncomputational efficiency, this work establishes a new paradigm for real-time\nelectrolyzer monitoring, accelerating deployment of safe, efficient green\nhydrogen infrastructure crucial for net-zero emissions targets."}

Materials and Methods: This institutional review board\napproved retrospective study included 1,847 single-breast MRI examinations (377\nBI-RADS >=4) from an in-house dataset and 924 from an external validation\ndataset (Duke). Four abbreviated protocols were tested: T1-weighted early\nsubtraction (T1sub), diffusion-weighted imaging with b=1500 s/mm2 (DWI1500),\nDWI1500+T2-weighted (T2w), and T1sub+T2w.

To address these limitations, AvatarTex\nintroduces a novel three-stage diffusion-to-GAN pipeline. Our key insight is\nthat while diffusion models excel at generating diversified textures, they lack\nexplicit UV constraints, whereas GANs provide a well-structured latent space\nthat ensures style and topology consistency. By integrating these strengths,\nAvatarTex achieves high-quality topology-aligned texture synthesis with both\nartistic and geometric coherence. Specifically, our three-stage pipeline first\ncompletes missing texture regions via diffusion-based inpainting, refines style\nand structure consistency using GAN-based latent optimization, and enhances\nfine details through diffusion-based repainting. To address the need for a\nstylized texture dataset, we introduce TexHub, a high-resolution collection of\n20,000 multi-style UV textures with precise UV-aligned layouts.

To overcome\nthese challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student\nlearning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision.

In this paper, we present a novel method\nthat uses a combination of IMU data and computer vision techniques for\nstitching images captured by a UAV. Our method involves several steps such as\nestimating the displacement and rotation of the UAV between consecutive images,\ncorrecting for perspective distortion, and computing a homography matrix. We\nthen use a standard image stitching algorithm to align and blend the images\ntogether. Our proposed method leverages the additional information provided by\nthe IMU data, corrects for various sources of distortion, and can be easily\nintegrated into existing UAV workflows. Our experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness and robustness of our method, outperforming some of the existing\nfeature-based image stitching algorithms in terms of accuracy and reliability,\nparticularly in challenging scenarios such as large displacements, rotations,\nand variations in camera pose."}

Despite that recent efforts have shown great potential\nby exploring generative approaches to address this issue, they often rely on\ndense voxel representations that are inefficient and struggle to preserve\nstructural detail. To fill this gap, we make the key observation that latent\ndiffusion models (LDMs), though successful in other modalities, have not been\neffectively leveraged for radar-based 3D generation due to a lack of compatible\nrepresentations and conditioning strategies. We introduce RaLD, a framework\nthat bridges this gap by integrating scene-level frustum-based LiDAR\nautoencoding, order-invariant latent representations, and direct radar spectrum\nconditioning. These insights lead to a more compact and expressive generation\nprocess.

With\nlatent variables drawn from a tractable probability density function that can\nbe further constrained, these models enable continuous and semantically rich\nexploration of the output space by navigating their latent spaces. Structured\nlatent representations are typically obtained through the joint minimization of\nregularization loss functions. In variational information bottleneck models,\nreconstruction loss and Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) are often linearly\ncombined with an auxiliary Attribute-Regularization (AR) loss. However,\nbalancing KLD and AR turns out to be a very delicate matter. When KLD dominates\nover AR, generative models tend to lack controllability; when AR dominates over\nKLD, the stochastic encoder is encouraged to violate the standard normal prior.\nWe explore this trade-off in the context of symbolic music generation with\nexplicit control over continuous musical attributes.

A\ncrucial question about AI reasoning is whether models can extrapolate learned\nreasoning patterns to solve harder tasks with longer chain-of-thought (CoT). In\nthis work, we present a theoretical analysis of transformers learning on\nsynthetic state-tracking tasks with gradient descent. We mathematically prove\nhow the algebraic structure of state-tracking problems governs the degree of\nextrapolation of the learned CoT. Specifically, our theory characterizes the\nlength generalization of transformers through the mechanism of attention\nconcentration, linking the retrieval robustness of the attention layer to the\nstate-tracking task structure of long-context reasoning. Moreover, for\ntransformers with limited reasoning length, we prove that a recursive\nself-training scheme can progressively extend the range of solvable problem\nlengths. To our knowledge, we provide the first optimization guarantee that\nconstant-depth transformers provably learn $\\mathsf{NC}^1$-complete problems\nwith CoT, significantly going beyond prior art confined in $\\mathsf{TC}^0$,\nunless the widely held conjecture $\\mathsf{TC}^0 \\neq \\mathsf{NC}^1$ fails.\nFinally, we present a broad set of experiments supporting our theoretical\nresults, confirming the length generalization behaviors and the mechanism of\nattention concentration."}

This approach\nsignificantly improves systematic generalization outside the training tasks.\nSubsequently, building on spatial abstraction, we developed the Skipper\nframework to automatically decompose complex tasks into simpler, more\nmanageable sub-tasks. Skipper provides robustness against distributional shifts\nand efficacy in long-term, compositional planning by focusing on pertinent\nspatial and temporal elements of the environment. Finally, we identified a\ncommon failure mode and safety risk in planning agents that rely on generative\nmodels to generate state targets during planning. It is revealed that most\nagents blindly trust the targets they hallucinate, resulting in delusional\nplanning behaviors. Inspired by how the human brain rejects delusional\nintentions, we propose learning a feasibility evaluator to enable rejecting\nhallucinated infeasible targets, which led to significant performance\nimprovements in various kinds of planning agents. Finally, we suggest\ndirections for future research, aimed at achieving general task abstraction and\nfully enabling abstract planning."}
