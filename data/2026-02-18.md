Abstract: Accurate polyp segmentation in colonoscopy is essential for cancer prevention but remains challenging due to: (1) high morphological variability (from flat to protruding lesions), (2) strong visual similarity to normal structures such as folds and vessels, and (3) the need for robust multi-scale detection. Existing deep learning approaches suffer from unidirectional processing, weak multi-scale fusion, and the absence of anatomical constraints, often leading to false positives (over-segmentation of normal structures) and false negatives (missed subtle flat lesions). We propose GRAFNet, a biologically inspired architecture that emulates the hierarchical organisation of the human visual system. GRAFNet integrates three key modules: (1) a Guided Asymmetric Attention Module (GAAM) that mimics orientation-tuned cortical neurones to emphasise polyp boundaries, (2) a MultiScale Retinal Module (MSRM) that replicates retinal ganglion cell pathways for parallel multi-feature analysis, and (3) a Guided Cortical Attention Feedback Module (GCAFM) that applies predictive coding for iterative refinement. These are unified in a Polyp Encoder-Decoder Module (PEDM) that enforces spatial-semantic consistency via resolution-adaptive feedback. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks (Kvasir-SEG, CVC-300, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-Clinic, and PolypGen) demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance, with 3-8% Dice improvements and 10-20% higher generalisation over leading methods, while offering interpretable decision pathways. This work establishes a paradigm in which neural computation principles bridge the gap between AI accuracy and clinically trustworthy reasoning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-object interaction (HOI) detection aims to locate humans and objects in images and recognize their interactions. While advances in open-vocabulary object detection provide promising solutions for object localization, interaction recognition (IR) remains challenging due to the combinatorial diversity of interactions. Existing methods, including two-stage methods, tightly couple IR with a specific detector and rely on coarse-grained vision-language model (VLM) features, which limit generalization to unseen interactions. In this work, we propose a decoupled framework that separates object detection from IR and leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for zero-shot IR. We introduce a deterministic generation method that formulates IR as a visual question answering task and enforces deterministic outputs, enabling training-free zero-shot IR. To further enhance performance and efficiency by fine-tuning the model, we design a spatial-aware pooling module that integrates appearance and pairwise spatial cues, and a one-pass deterministic matching method that predicts all candidate interactions in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO demonstrate that our method achieves superior zero-shot performance, strong cross-dataset generalization, and the flexibility to integrate with any object detectors without retraining. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/SY-Xuan/DA-HOI.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: High-quality video datasets are foundational for training robust models in tasks like action recognition, phase detection, and event segmentation. However, many real-world video datasets suffer from annotation errors such as *mislabeling*, where segments are assigned incorrect class labels, and *disordering*, where the temporal sequence does not follow the correct progression. These errors are particularly harmful in phase-annotated tasks, where temporal consistency is critical. We propose a novel, model-agnostic method for detecting annotation errors by analyzing the Cumulative Sample Loss (CSL)--defined as the average loss a frame incurs when passing through model checkpoints saved across training epochs. This per-frame loss trajectory acts as a dynamic fingerprint of frame-level learnability. Mislabeled or disordered frames tend to show consistently high or irregular loss patterns, as they remain difficult for the model to learn throughout training, while correctly labeled frames typically converge to low loss early. To compute CSL, we train a video segmentation model and store its weights at each epoch. These checkpoints are then used to evaluate the loss of each frame in a test video. Frames with persistently high CSL are flagged as likely candidates for annotation errors, including mislabeling or temporal misalignment. Our method does not require ground truth on annotation errors and is generalizable across datasets. Experiments on EgoPER and Cholec80 demonstrate strong detection performance, effectively identifying subtle inconsistencies such as mislabeling and frame disordering. The proposed approach provides a powerful tool for dataset auditing and improving training reliability in video-based machine learning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Super-resolution is widely used in medical imaging to enhance low-quality data, reducing scan time and improving abnormality detection. Conventional super-resolution approaches typically rely on paired datasets of downsampled and original high resolution images, training models to reconstruct high resolution images from their artificially degraded counterparts. However, in real-world clinical settings, low resolution data often arise from acquisition mechanisms that differ significantly from simple downsampling. As a result, these inputs may lie outside the domain of the training data, leading to poor model generalization due to domain shift. To address this limitation, we propose a distributional deep learning framework that improves model robustness and domain generalization. We develop this approch for enhancing the resolution of 4D Flow MRI (4DF). This is a novel imaging modality that captures hemodynamic flow velocity and clinically relevant metrics such as vessel wall stress. These metrics are critical for assessing aneurysm rupture risk. Our model is initially trained on high resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and their downsampled counterparts. It is then fine-tuned on a small, harmonized dataset of paired 4D Flow MRI and CFD samples. We derive the theoretical properties of our distributional estimators and demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms traditional deep learning approaches through real data applications. This highlights the effectiveness of distributional learning in addressing domain shift and improving super-resolution performance in clinically realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Camera virtualization -- an emerging solution to novel view synthesis -- holds transformative potential for visual entertainment, live performances, and sports broadcasting by enabling the generation of photorealistic images from novel viewpoints using images from a limited set of calibrated multiple static physical cameras. Despite recent advances, achieving spatially and temporally coherent and photorealistic rendering of dynamic scenes with efficient time-archival capabilities, particularly in fast-paced sports and stage performances, remains challenging for existing approaches. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for dynamic scenes could offer real-time view-synthesis results. Yet, they are hindered by their dependence on accurate 3D point clouds from the structure-from-motion method and their inability to handle large, non-rigid, rapid motions of different subjects (e.g., flips, jumps, articulations, sudden player-to-player transitions). Moreover, independent motions of multiple subjects can break the Gaussian-tracking assumptions commonly used in 4DGS, ST-GS, and other dynamic splatting variants. This paper advocates reconsidering a neural volume rendering formulation for camera virtualization and efficient time-archival capabilities, making it useful for sports broadcasting and related applications. By modeling a dynamic scene as rigid transformations across multiple synchronized camera views at a given time, our method performs neural representation learning, providing enhanced visual rendering quality at test time. A key contribution of our approach is its support for time-archival, i.e., users can revisit any past temporal instance of a dynamic scene and can perform novel view synthesis, enabling retrospective rendering for replay, analysis, and archival of live events, a functionality absent in existing neural rendering approaches and novel view synthesis...

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive, large-scale study of training long-context vision language models up to 344K context, targeting long-document visual question answering with measured transfer to long-context text. While several such strong are open-weight, namely Qwen3 VL and GLM 4.5/6V, their training recipes and data pipelines are not reproducible. We systematically study continued pretraining, supervised finetuning, and preference optimization for 24B and 32B parameter models, backed by extensive LC evaluations and ablations to bridge this gap, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBenchDoc for both parameter scales. In addition to this, our key findings include: (i) training on context lengths that match evaluation context lengths outperforms training on longer contexts, (ii) training and evaluating with page indices provides a simple, high-impact boost to long-document performance, (iii) our synthetic data pipelines enable self-improvement via continued pretraining and supervised finetuning, and (iv) we extend the known text-to-visual long context transfer to the reverse, showing that visual long context training transfers to long-context text performance. We also release MMLBD-C, a manually corrected version of MMLongBenchDoc to reduce erroneous and low quality examples in the benchmark.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses the original data into compact synthetic datasets, reducing training time and storage while retaining model performance, enabling deployment under limited resources. Although recent decoupling-based distillation methods enable dataset distillation at large-scale, they continue to face an efficiency gap: optimization-based decoupling methods achieve higher accuracy but demand intensive computation, whereas optimization-free decoupling methods are efficient but sacrifice accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, we propose Exploration-Exploitation Distillation (E^2D), a simple, practical method that minimizes redundant computation through an efficient pipeline that begins with full-image initialization to preserve semantic integrity and feature diversity. It then uses a two-phase optimization strategy: an exploration phase that performs uniform updates and identifies high-loss regions, and an exploitation phase that focuses updates on these regions to accelerate convergence. We evaluate E^2D on large-scale benchmarks, surpassing the state-of-the-art on ImageNet-1K while being 18x faster, and on ImageNet-21K, our method substantially improves accuracy while remaining 4.3x faster. These results demonstrate that targeted, redundancy-reducing updates, rather than brute-force optimization, bridge the gap between accuracy and efficiency in large-scale dataset distillation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The web is littered with images, once created for human consumption and now increasingly interpreted by agents using vision-language models (VLMs). These agents make visual decisions at scale, deciding what to click, recommend, or buy. Yet, we know little about the structure of their visual preferences. We introduce a framework for studying this by placing VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks and systematically perturbing their inputs. Our key idea is to treat the agent's decision function as a latent visual utility that can be inferred through revealed preference: choices between systematically edited images. Starting from common images, such as product photos, we propose methods for visual prompt optimization, adapting text optimization methods to iteratively propose and apply visually plausible modifications using an image generation model (such as in composition, lighting, or background). We then evaluate which edits increase selection probability. Through large-scale experiments on frontier VLMs, we demonstrate that optimized edits significantly shift choice probabilities in head-to-head comparisons. We develop an automatic interpretability pipeline to explain these preferences, identifying consistent visual themes that drive selection. We argue that this approach offers a practical and efficient way to surface visual vulnerabilities, safety concerns that might otherwise be discovered implicitly in the wild, supporting more proactive auditing and governance of image-based AI agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Text-to-video generation is expensive, so only a few samples are typically produced per prompt. In this low-sample regime, maximizing the value of each batch requires high cross-video diversity. Recent methods improve diversity for image generation, but for videos they often degrade within-video temporal consistency and require costly backpropagation through a video decoder. We propose a joint-sampling framework for flow-matching video generators that improves batch diversity while preserving temporal consistency. Our approach applies diversity-driven updates and then removes only the components that would decrease a temporal-consistency objective. To avoid image-space gradients, we compute both objectives with lightweight latent-space models, avoiding video decoding and decoder backpropagation. Experiments on a state-of-the-art text-to-video flow-matching model show diversity comparable to strong joint-sampling baselines while substantially improving temporal consistency and color naturalness. Code will be released.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) has gained increasing attention in medical imaging as a way to identify abnormalities without task-specific supervision, but most advances remain limited to 2D datasets. Extending ZSAD to 3D medical images has proven challenging, with existing methods relying on slice-wise features and vision-language models, which fail to capture volumetric structure. In this paper, we introduce a fully training-free framework for ZSAD in 3D brain MRI that constructs localized volumetric tokens by aggregating multi-axis slices processed by 2D foundation models. These 3D patch tokens restore cubic spatial context and integrate directly with distance-based, batch-level anomaly detection pipelines. The framework provides compact 3D representations that are practical to compute on standard GPUs and require no fine-tuning, prompts, or supervision. Our results show that training-free, batch-based ZSAD can be effectively extended from 2D encoders to full 3D MRI volumes, offering a simple and robust approach for volumetric anomaly detection.

Abstract: Although speculative decoding is widely used to accelerate Vision-Language Models (VLMs) inference, it faces severe performance collapse when applied to Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs). The draft model typically falls into the trap of attention dilution and negative visual gain due to key-value cache explosion and context window mismatches. We observe a visual semantic internalization phenomenon in Vid-LLMs, indicating that critical visual semantics are implicitly encoded into text hidden states during deep-layer interactions, which renders raw visual inputs structurally redundant during deep inference. To address this, we propose the Sparrow framework, which first utilizes visually-aware text-anchored window attention via hidden state reuse to fully offload visual computation to the target model, and leverages intermediate-layer visual state bridging to train the draft model with semantic-rich intermediate states, thereby filtering out low-level visual noise. Additionally, a multi-token prediction strategy is introduced to bridge the training-inference distribution shift. Experiments show that Sparrow achieves an average speedup of 2.82x even with 25k visual tokens, effectively resolving the performance degradation in long sequences and offering a practical solution for real-time long video tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Online video understanding requires models to perform continuous perception and long-range reasoning within potentially infinite visual streams. Its fundamental challenge lies in the conflict between the unbounded nature of streaming media input and the limited context window of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods primarily rely on passive processing, which often face a trade-off between maintaining long-range context and capturing the fine-grained details necessary for complex tasks. To address this, we introduce EventMemAgent, an active online video agent framework based on a hierarchical memory module. Our framework employs a dual-layer strategy for online videos: short-term memory detects event boundaries and utilizes event-granular reservoir sampling to process streaming video frames within a fixed-length buffer dynamically; long-term memory structuredly archives past observations on an event-by-event basis. Furthermore, we integrate a multi-granular perception toolkit for active, iterative evidence capture and employ Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) to end-to-end internalize reasoning and tool-use strategies into the agent's intrinsic capabilities. Experiments show that EventMemAgent achieves competitive results on online video benchmarks. The code will be released here: https://github.com/lingcco/EventMemAgent.

Abstract: Multimodal Fusion Learning (MFL), leveraging disparate data from various imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT, SPECT), has shown great potential for addressing medical problems such as skin cancer and brain tumor prediction. However, existing MFL methods face three key limitations: a) they often specialize in specific modalities, and overlook effective shared complementary information across diverse modalities, hence limiting their generalizability for multi-disease analysis; b) they rely on computationally expensive models, restricting their applicability in resource-limited settings; and c) they lack robustness against adversarial attacks, compromising reliability in medical AI applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multi-Attention Integration Learning (MAIL) network, incorporating two key components: a) an efficient residual learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific multi-scale patterns and b) an efficient multimodal cross-attention module for learning enriched complementary shared representations across diverse modalities. Furthermore, to ensure adversarial robustness, we extend MAIL network to design Robust-MAIL by incorporating random projection filters and modulated attention noise. Extensive evaluations on 20 public datasets show that both MAIL and Robust-MAIL outperform existing methods, achieving performance gains of up to 9.34% while reducing computational costs by up to 78.3%. These results highlight the superiority of our approaches, ensuring more reliable predictions than top competitors. Code: https://github.com/misti1203/MAIL-Robust-MAIL.

Abstract: Dog emotion recognition plays a crucial role in enhancing human-animal interactions, veterinary care, and the development of automated systems for monitoring canine well-being. However, accurately interpreting dog emotions is challenging due to the subjective nature of emotional assessments and the absence of standardized ground truth methods. We present the CREMD (Crowd-sourced Emotional Multimodal Dogs Dataset), a comprehensive dataset exploring how different presentation modes (e.g., context, audio, video) and annotator characteristics (e.g., dog ownership, gender, professional experience) influence the perception and labeling of dog emotions. The dataset consists of 923 video clips presented in three distinct modes: without context or audio, with context but no audio, and with both context and audio. We analyze annotations from diverse participants, including dog owners, professionals, and individuals with varying demographic backgrounds and experience levels, to identify factors that influence reliable dog emotion recognition. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) while adding visual context significantly improved annotation agreement, our findings regarding audio cues are inconclusive due to design limitations (specifically, the absence of a no-context-with-audio condition and limited clean audio availability); (2) contrary to expectations, non-owners and male annotators showed higher agreement levels than dog owners and female annotators, respectively, while professionals showed higher agreement levels, aligned with our initial hypothesis; and (3) the presence of audio substantially increased annotators' confidence in identifying specific emotions, particularly anger and fear.

Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has fundamentally redefined the capabilities of photorealistic neural rendering by enabling high-throughput synthesis of complex environments. While procedural methods like Wang Tiles have recently been integrated to facilitate the generation of expansive landscapes, these systems typically remain constrained by a reliance on densely sampled exemplar reconstructions. We present DAV-GSWT, a data-efficient framework that leverages diffusion priors and active view sampling to synthesize high-fidelity Gaussian Splatting Wang Tiles from minimal input observations. By integrating a hierarchical uncertainty quantification mechanism with generative diffusion models, our approach autonomously identifies the most informative viewpoints while hallucinating missing structural details to ensure seamless tile transitions. Experimental results indicate that our system significantly reduces the required data volume while maintaining the visual integrity and interactive performance necessary for large-scale virtual environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Generative models have made it possible to synthesize highly realistic images, potentially providing an abundant data source for training machine learning models. Despite the advantages of these synthesizable data sources, the indiscriminate use of generated images as real images for training can even cause mode collapse due to modality discrepancies between real and synthetic domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for discriminative use of generated images, coined GMAIL, that explicitly treats generated images as a separate modality from real images. Instead of indiscriminately replacing real images with generated ones in the pixel space, our approach bridges the two distinct modalities in the same latent space through a multi-modal learning approach. To be specific, we first fine-tune a model exclusively on generated images using a cross-modality alignment loss and then employ this aligned model to further train various vision-language models with generated images. By aligning the two modalities, our approach effectively leverages the benefits of recent advances in generative models, thereby boosting the effectiveness of generated image learning across a range of vision-language tasks. Our framework can be easily incorporated with various vision-language models, and we demonstrate its efficacy throughout extensive experiments. For example, our framework significantly improves performance on image captioning, zero-shot image retrieval, zero-shot image classification, and long caption retrieval tasks. It also shows positive generated data scaling trends and notable enhancements in the captioning performance of the large multimodal model, LLaVA.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Day-to-night unpaired image translation is important to downstream tasks but remains challenging due to large appearance shifts and the lack of direct pixel-level supervision. Existing methods often introduce semantic hallucinations, where objects from target classes such as traffic signs and vehicles, as well as man-made light effects, are incorrectly synthesized. These hallucinations significantly degrade downstream performance. We propose a novel framework that detects and suppresses hallucinations of target-class features during unpaired translation. To detect hallucination, we design a dual-head discriminator that additionally performs semantic segmentation to identify hallucinated content in background regions. To suppress these hallucinations, we introduce class-specific prototypes, constructed by aggregating features of annotated target-domain objects, which act as semantic anchors for each class. Built upon a Schrodinger Bridge-based translation model, our framework performs iterative refinement, where detected hallucination features are explicitly pushed away from class prototypes in feature space, thus preserving object semantics across the translation trajectory.Experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. On the BDD100K dataset, it improves mAP by 15.5% for day-to-night domain adaptation, with a notable 31.7% gain for classes such as traffic lights that are prone to hallucinations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion models often yield highly curved trajectories and noisy score targets due to an uninformative, memoryless forward process that induces independent data-noise coupling. We propose Adjoint Schrödinger Bridge Matching (ASBM), a generative modeling framework that recovers optimal trajectories in high dimensions via two stages. First, we view the Schrödinger Bridge (SB) forward dynamic as a coupling construction problem and learn it through a data-to-energy sampling perspective that transports data to an energy-defined prior. Then, we learn the backward generative dynamic with a simple matching loss supervised by the induced optimal coupling. By operating in a non-memoryless regime, ASBM produces significantly straighter and more efficient sampling paths. Compared to prior works, ASBM scales to high-dimensional data with notably improved stability and efficiency. Extensive experiments on image generation show that ASBM improves fidelity with fewer sampling steps. We further showcase the effectiveness of our optimal trajectory via distillation to a one-step generator.

Abstract: Face morphing attacks threaten biometric verification, yet most morphing attack detection (MAD) systems require task-specific training and generalize poorly to unseen attack types. Meanwhile, open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong visual-linguistic reasoning, but their potential in biometric forensics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of open-source MLLMs for single-image MAD, using publicly available weights and a standardized, reproducible protocol. Across diverse morphing techniques, many MLLMs show non-trivial discriminative ability without any fine-tuning or domain adaptation, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing highly competitive task-specific MAD baselines by at least 23% in terms of equal error rate (EER). The results indicate that multimodal pretraining can implicitly encode fine-grained facial inconsistencies indicative of morphing artifacts, enabling zero-shot forensic sensitivity. Our findings position open-source MLLMs as reproducible, interpretable, and competitive foundations for biometric security and forensic image analysis. This emergent capability also highlights new opportunities to develop state-of-the-art MAD systems through targeted fine-tuning or lightweight adaptation, further improving accuracy and efficiency while preserving interpretability. To support future research, all code and evaluation protocols will be released upon publication.

Abstract: General-purpose super-resolution models, particularly Vision Transformers, have achieved remarkable success but exhibit fundamental inefficiencies in common infrared imaging scenarios like surveillance and autonomous driving, which operate from fixed or nearly-static viewpoints. These models fail to exploit the strong, persistent spatial priors inherent in such scenes, leading to redundant learning and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Regional Prior attention Transformer for infrared image Super-Resolution (RPT-SR), a novel architecture that explicitly encodes scene layout information into the attention mechanism. Our core contribution is a dual-token framework that fuses (1) learnable, regional prior tokens, which act as a persistent memory for the scene's global structure, with (2) local tokens that capture the frame-specific content of the current input. By utilizing these tokens into an attention, our model allows the priors to dynamically modulate the local reconstruction process. Extensive experiments validate our approach. While most prior works focus on a single infrared band, we demonstrate the broad applicability and versatility of RPT-SR by establishing new state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets covering both Long-Wave (LWIR) and Short-Wave (SWIR) spectra

Abstract: Minutiae extraction, a fundamental stage in fingerprint recognition, is increasingly shifting toward deep learning. However, truly end-to-end methods that eliminate separate preprocessing and postprocessing steps remain scarce. This paper introduces LEADER (Lightweight End-to-end Attention-gated Dual autoencodER), a neural network that maps raw fingerprint images to minutiae descriptors, including location, direction, and type. The proposed architecture integrates non-maximum suppression and angular decoding to enable complete end-to-end inference using only 0.9M parameters. It employs a novel "Castle-Moat-Rampart" ground-truth encoding and a dual-autoencoder structure, interconnected through an attention-gating mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on plain fingerprints and robust cross-domain generalization to latent impressions. Specifically, LEADER attains a 34% higher F1-score on the NIST SD27 dataset compared to specialized latent minutiae extractors. Sample-level analysis on this challenging benchmark reveals an average rank of 2.07 among all compared methods, with LEADER securing the first-place position in 47% of the samples-more than doubling the frequency of the second-best extractor. The internal representations learned by the model align with established fingerprint domain features, such as segmentation masks, orientation fields, frequency maps, and skeletons. Inference requires 15ms on GPU and 322ms on CPU, outperforming leading commercial software in computational efficiency. The source code and pre-trained weights are publicly released to facilitate reproducibility.

Abstract: Transient objects in casual multi-view captures cause ghosting artifacts in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstruction. Existing solutions relied on scene decomposition at significant memory cost or on motion-based heuristics that were vulnerable to parallax ambiguity. A semantic filtering framework was proposed for category-aware transient removal using vision-language models. CLIP similarity scores between rendered views and distractor text prompts were accumulated per-Gaussian across training iterations. Gaussians exceeding a calibrated threshold underwent opacity regularization and periodic pruning. Unlike motion-based approaches, semantic classification resolved parallax ambiguity by identifying object categories independently of motion patterns. Experiments on the RobustNeRF benchmark demonstrated consistent improvement in reconstruction quality over vanilla 3DGS across four sequences, while maintaining minimal memory overhead and real-time rendering performance. Threshold calibration and comparisons with baselines validated semantic guidance as a practical strategy for transient removal in scenarios with predictable distractor categories.

Abstract: Quantifying biometric characteristics within hand gestures involve derivation of fitness scores from a gesture and identity aware feature space. However, evaluating the quality of these scores remains an open question. Existing biometric capacity estimation literature relies upon error rates. But these rates do not indicate goodness of scores. Thus, in this manuscript we present an exhaustive set of evaluation measures. We firstly identify ranking order and relevance of output scores as the primary basis for evaluation. In particular, we consider both rank deviation as well as rewards for: (i) higher scores of high ranked gestures and (ii) lower scores of low ranked gestures. We also compensate for correspondence between trends of output and ground truth scores. Finally, we account for disentanglement between identity features of gestures as a discounting factor. Integrating these elements with adequate weighting, we formulate advanced acceptance score as a holistic evaluation measure. To assess effectivity of the proposed we perform in-depth experimentation over three datasets with five state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Results show that the optimal score selected with our measure is more appropriate than existing other measures. Also, our proposed measure depicts correlation with existing measures. This further validates its reliability. We have made our \href{https://github.com/AmanVerma2307/MeasureSuite}{code} public.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored the combination of multiple LoRAs to simultaneously generate user-specified subjects and styles. However, most existing approaches fuse LoRA weights using static statistical heuristics that deviate from LoRA's original purpose of learning adaptive feature adjustments and ignore the randomness of sampled inputs. To address this, we propose a dynamic training-free fusion framework that operates throughout the generation process. During the forward pass, at each LoRA-applied layer, we dynamically compute the KL divergence between the base model's original features and those produced by subject and style LoRAs, respectively, and adaptively select the most appropriate weights for fusion. In the reverse denoising stage, we further refine the generation trajectory by dynamically applying gradient-based corrections derived from objective metrics such as CLIP and DINO scores, providing continuous semantic and stylistic guidance. By integrating these two complementary mechanisms-feature-level selection and metric-guided latent adjustment-across the entire diffusion timeline, our method dynamically achieves coherent subject-style synthesis without any retraining. Extensive experiments across diverse subject-style combinations demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LoRA fusion methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: LVLMs have achieved strong multimodal reasoning capabilities but remain prone to hallucinations, producing outputs inconsistent with visual inputs or user instructions. Existing training-free methods, including contrastive decoding and auxiliary expert models, which incur several times more computational overhead and may introduce potential interference, as well as static internal signal enhancement, are often vulnerable to the attention sink phenomenon. We find that internal Positive Attention Dynamics (PAD) in LVLMs naturally reveal semantically core visual regions under the distortions of attention sinks. Based on this, we propose Positive Attention Dynamics Enhancement (PADE), a training-free attention intervention that constructs a PAD map to identify semantically core visual regions, applies per-head Median Absolute Deviation Scaling to adaptively control the intervention strength, and leverages System-Token Compensation to maintain attention to complex user instructions and support long-term output consistency. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that PADE improves visual grounding and reduces hallucinations, validating the effectiveness of leveraging internal attention dynamics for reliable multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Intracoronary Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution visualization of coronary vessel anatomy but presents challenges due to noise, imaging artifacts, and complex tissue structures. This paper proposes a fully automated pipeline for vessel segmentation and classification in OCT images using machine learning techniques. The proposed method integrates image preprocessing, guidewire artifact removal, polar-to-Cartesian transformation, unsupervised K-means clustering, and local feature extraction. These features are used to train Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine classifiers for pixel-wise vessel classification. Experimental results demonstrate excellent performance, achieving precision, recall, and F1-score values up to 1.00 and overall classification accuracy of 99.68%. The proposed approach provides accurate vessel boundary detection while maintaining low computational complexity and requiring minimal manual annotation. This method offers a reliable and efficient solution for automated OCT image analysis and has potential applications in clinical decision support and real-time medical image processing.

Abstract: Aligning functional schematics with 2D and 3D scene acquisitions is crucial for building digital twins, especially for old industrial facilities that lack native digital models. Current manual alignment using images and LiDAR data does not scale due to tediousness and complexity of industrial sites. Inconsistencies between schematics and reality, and the scarcity of public industrial datasets, make the problem both challenging and underexplored. This paper introduces IRIS-v2, a comprehensive dataset to support further research. It includes images, point clouds, 2D annotated boxes and segmentation masks, a CAD model, 3D pipe routing information, and the P&ID (Piping and Instrumentation Diagram). The alignment is experimented on a practical case study, aiming at reducing the time required for this task by combining segmentation and graph matching.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) through Vision-Language Models (VLMs) promises to reduce documentation burden, improve reporting consistency, and accelerate clinical workflows. However, their clinical adoption remains limited by the lack of interpretability and the tendency to hallucinate findings misaligned with imaging evidence. Existing research typically treats interpretability and accuracy as separate objectives, with concept-based explainability techniques focusing primarily on transparency, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods targeting factual grounding through external retrieval. We present Concept-Enhanced Multimodal RAG (CEMRAG), a unified framework that decomposes visual representations into interpretable clinical concepts and integrates them with multimodal RAG. This approach exploits enriched contextual prompts for RRG, improving both interpretability and factual accuracy. Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray across multiple VLM architectures, training regimes, and retrieval configurations demonstrate consistent improvements over both conventional RAG and concept-only baselines on clinical accuracy metrics and standard NLP measures. These results challenge the assumed trade-off between interpretability and performance, showing that transparent visual concepts can enhance rather than compromise diagnostic accuracy in medical VLMs. Our modular design decomposes interpretability into visual transparency and structured language model conditioning, providing a principled pathway toward clinically trustworthy AI-assisted radiology.

Abstract: The strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa), known worldwide for its economic value and nutritional richness, is a widely cultivated fruit. Determining the correct ripeness level during the harvest period is crucial for both preventing losses for producers and ensuring consumers receive a quality product. However, traditional methods, i.e., visual assessments alone, can be subjective and have a high margin of error. Therefore, computer-assisted systems are needed. However, the scarcity of comprehensive datasets accessible to everyone in the literature makes it difficult to compare studies in this field. In this study, a new and publicly available strawberry ripeness dataset, consisting of 566 images and 1,201 labeled objects, prepared under variable light and environmental conditions in two different greenhouses in Turkey, is presented to the literature. Comparative tests conducted on the data set using YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLO11-based models showed that the highest precision value was 90.94% in the YOLOv9c model, while the highest recall value was 83.74% in the YOLO11s model. In terms of the general performance criterion mAP@50, YOLOv8s was the best performing model with a success rate of 86.09%. The results show that small and medium-sized models work more balanced and efficiently on this type of dataset, while also establishing a fundamental reference point for smart agriculture applications.

Abstract: Deep learning-based segmentation and classification are crucial to large-scale biomedical imaging, particularly for 3D data, where manual analysis is impractical. Although many methods exist, selecting suitable models and tuning parameters remains a major bottleneck in practice. Hence, we introduce the 3D data Analysis Optimization Pipeline, a method designed to facilitate the design and parameterization of segmentation and classification using two Bayesian Optimization stages. First, the pipeline selects a segmentation model and optimizes postprocessing parameters using a domain-adapted syntactic benchmark dataset. To ensure a concise evaluation of segmentation performance, we introduce a segmentation quality metric that serves as the objective function. Second, the pipeline optimizes design choices of a classifier, such as encoder and classifier head architectures, incorporation of prior knowledge, and pretraining strategies. To reduce manual annotation effort, this stage includes an assisted class-annotation workflow that extracts predicted instances from the segmentation results and sequentially presents them to the operator, eliminating the need for manual tracking. In four case studies, the 3D data Analysis Optimization Pipeline efficiently identifies effective model and parameter configurations for individual datasets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Across the natural and life sciences, images have become a primary measurement modality, yet the dominant analytic paradigm remains semantics-first. Structure is recovered by predicting or enforcing domain-specific labels. This paradigm fails systematically under the conditions that make image-based science most valuable, including open-ended scientific discovery, cross-sensor and cross-site comparability, and long-term monitoring in which domain ontologies and associated label sets drift culturally, institutionally, and ecologically. A deductive inversion is proposed in the form of criteria-first and semantics-later. A unified framework for criteria-first structure discovery is introduced. It separates criterion-defined, semantics-free structure extraction from downstream semantic mapping into domain ontologies or vocabularies and provides a domain-general scaffold for reproducible analysis across image-based sciences. Reproducible science requires that the first analytic layer perform criterion-driven, semantics-free structure discovery, yielding stable partitions, structural fields, or hierarchies defined by explicit optimality criteria rather than local domain ontologies. Semantics is not discarded; it is relocated downstream as an explicit mapping from the discovered structural product to a domain ontology or vocabulary, enabling plural interpretations and explicit crosswalks without rewriting upstream extraction. Grounded in cybernetics, observation-as-distinction, and information theory's separation of information from meaning, the argument is supported by cross-domain evidence showing that criteria-first components recur whenever labels do not scale. Finally, consequences are outlined for validation beyond class accuracy and for treating structural products as FAIR, AI-ready digital objects for long-term monitoring and digital twins.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success across various vision tasks, yet their deployment is often hindered by prohibitive computational costs. While structured weight pruning and token compression have emerged as promising solutions, they suffer from prolonged retraining times and global propagation that creates optimization challenges, respectively. We propose ToaSt, a decoupled framework applying specialized strategies to distinct ViT components. We apply coupled head-wise structured pruning to Multi-Head Self-Attention modules, leveraging attention operation characteristics to enhance robustness. For Feed-Forward Networks (over 60\% of FLOPs), we introduce Token Channel Selection (TCS) that enhances compression ratios while avoiding global propagation issues. Our analysis reveals TCS effectively filters redundant noise during selection. Extensive evaluations across nine diverse models, including DeiT, ViT-MAE, and Swin Transformer, demonstrate that ToaSt achieves superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, consistently outperforming existing baselines. On ViT-MAE-Huge, ToaSt achieves 88.52\% accuracy (+1.64 \%) with 39.4\% FLOPs reduction. ToaSt transfers effectively to downstream tasks, cccccachieving 52.2 versus 51.9 mAP on COCO object detection. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to follow natural-language instructions and navigate through previously unseen environments. Recent approaches increasingly employ large language models (LLMs) as high-level navigators due to their flexibility and reasoning capability. However, prompt-based LLM navigation often suffers from inefficient decision-making, as the model must repeatedly interpret instructions from scratch and reason over noisy and verbose navigable candidates at each step. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented framework to improve the efficiency and stability of LLM-based VLN without modifying or fine-tuning the underlying language model. Our approach introduces retrieval at two complementary levels. At the episode level, an instruction-level embedding retriever selects semantically similar successful navigation trajectories as in-context exemplars, providing task-specific priors for instruction grounding. At the step level, an imitation-learned candidate retriever prunes irrelevant navigable directions before LLM inference, reducing action ambiguity and prompt complexity. Both retrieval modules are lightweight, modular, and trained independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method on the Room-to-Room (R2R) benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in Success Rate, Oracle Success Rate, and SPL on both seen and unseen environments. Ablation studies further show that instruction-level exemplar retrieval and candidate pruning contribute complementary benefits to global guidance and step-wise decision efficiency. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented decision support is an effective and scalable strategy for enhancing LLM-based vision-and-language navigation.

Abstract: Existing 3D open-vocabulary scene understanding methods mostly emphasize distilling language features from 2D foundation models into 3D feature fields, but largely overlook the synergy among scene appearance, semantics, and geometry. As a result, scene understanding often deviates from the underlying geometric structure of scenes and becomes decoupled from the reconstruction process. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages language and geometry grounded sparse voxel representations to comprehensively model appearance, semantics, and geometry within a unified framework. Specifically, we use 3D sparse voxels as primitives and employ an appearance field, a density field, a feature field, and a confidence field to holistically represent a 3D scene. To promote synergy among the appearance, density, and feature fields, we construct a feature modulation module and distill language features from a 2D foundation model into our 3D scene model. In addition, we integrate geometric distillation into feature field distillation to transfer geometric knowledge from a geometry foundation model to our 3D scene representations via depth correlation regularization and pattern consistency regularization. These components work together to synergistically model the appearance, semantics, and geometry of the 3D scene within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior overall performance compared with state-of-the-art methods in holistic scene understanding and reconstruction.

Abstract: This paper introduces RaCo, a lightweight neural network designed to learn robust and versatile keypoints suitable for a variety of 3D computer vision tasks. The model integrates three key components: the repeatable keypoint detector, a differentiable ranker to maximize matches with a limited number of keypoints, and a covariance estimator to quantify spatial uncertainty in metric scale. Trained on perspective image crops only, RaCo operates without the need for covisible image pairs. It achieves strong rotational robustness through extensive data augmentation, even without the use of computationally expensive equivariant network architectures. The method is evaluated on several challenging datasets, where it demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in keypoint repeatability and two-view matching, particularly under large in-plane rotations. Ultimately, RaCo provides an effective and simple strategy to independently estimate keypoint ranking and metric covariance without additional labels, detecting interpretable and repeatable interest points. The code is available at https://github.com/cvg/RaCo.

Abstract: Current research in multimodal models faces a key challenge where enhancing generative capabilities often comes at the expense of understanding, and vice versa. We analyzed this trade-off and identify the primary cause might be the potential conflict between generation and understanding, which creates a competitive dynamic within the model. To address this, we propose the Reason-Reflect-Refine (R3) framework. This innovative algorithm re-frames the single-step generation task into a multi-step process of "generate-understand-regenerate". By explicitly leveraging the model's understanding capability during generation, we successfully mitigate the optimization dilemma, achieved stronger generation results and improved understanding ability which are related to the generation process. This offers valuable insights for designing next-generation unified multimodal models. Code is available at https://github.com/sen-ye/R3.

Abstract: Endoscopy is essential in medical imaging, used for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Developing a robust dynamic 3D reconstruction pipeline for endoscopic videos could enhance visualization, improve diagnostic accuracy, aid in treatment planning, and guide surgery procedures. However, challenges arise due to the deformable nature of the tissues, the use of monocular cameras, illumination changes, occlusions and unknown camera trajectories. Inspired by neural rendering, we introduce NeRFscopy, a self-supervised pipeline for novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction of deformable endoscopic tissues from a monocular video. NeRFscopy includes a deformable model with a canonical radiance field and a time-dependent deformation field parameterized by SE(3) transformations. In addition, the color images are efficiently exploited by introducing sophisticated terms to learn a 3D implicit model without assuming any template or pre-trained model, solely from data. NeRFscopy achieves accurate results in terms of novel view synthesis, outperforming competing methods across various challenging endoscopy scenes.

Abstract: Due to the rise in the use of renewable energies as an alternative to traditional ones, and especially solar energy, there is increasing interest in studying how to address photovoltaic forecasting in the face of the challenge of variability in photovoltaic energy production, using different methodologies. This work develops a hybrid approach for short and long-term forecasting based on two studies with the same purpose. A multimodal approach that combines images of the sky and photovoltaic energy history with meteorological data is proposed. The main goal is to improve the accuracy of ramp event prediction, increase the robustness of forecasts in cloudy conditions, and extend capabilities beyond nowcasting, to support more efficient operation of the power grid and better management of solar variability. Deep neural models are used for both nowcasting and forecasting solutions, incorporating individual and multiple meteorological variables, as well as an analytical solar position. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of meteorological data, particularly the surface long-wave, radiation downwards, and the combination of wind and solar position, significantly improves current predictions in both nowcasting and forecasting tasks, especially on cloudy days. This study highlights the importance of integrating diverse data sources to improve the reliability and interpretability of solar energy prediction models.

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) from cancer patients contain rich information that can be used for medical diagnosis or to follow treatment progress. To automate their analysis, numerous deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks and Vision Transformers have been developed and have achieved strong performance in segmentation and classification tasks. However, due to the large size and complex cellular organization of WSIs, these models rely on patch-based representations, losing vital tissue-level context. We propose using scalable Graph Transformers on a full-WSI cell graph for classification. We evaluate this methodology on a challenging task: the classification of healthy versus tumor epithelial cells in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), where both cell types exhibit very similar morphologies and are therefore difficult to differentiate for image-based approaches. We first compared image-based and graph-based methods on a single WSI. Graph Transformer models SGFormer and DIFFormer achieved balanced accuracies of $85.2 \pm 1.5$ ($\pm$ standard error) and $85.1 \pm 2.5$ in 3-fold cross-validation, respectively, whereas the best image-based method reached $81.2 \pm 3.0$. By evaluating several node feature configurations, we found that the most informative representation combined morphological and texture features as well as the cell classes of non-epithelial cells, highlighting the importance of the surrounding cellular context. We then extended our work to train on several WSIs from several patients. To address the computational constraints of image-based models, we extracted four $2560 \times 2560$ pixel patches from each image and converted them into graphs. In this setting, DIFFormer achieved a balanced accuracy of $83.6 \pm 1.9$ (3-fold cross-validation), while the state-of-the-art image-based model CellViT256 reached $78.1 \pm 0.5$.

Abstract: Clinical deployment of chest radiograph classifiers requires models that can be updated as new datasets become available without retraining on previously ob- served data or degrading validated performance. We study, for the first time, a task-incremental continual learning setting for chest radiograph classification, in which heterogeneous chest X-ray datasets arrive sequentially and task identifiers are unavailable at inference. We propose a continual adapter-based routing learning strategy for Chest X-rays (CARL-XRay) that maintains a fixed high-capacity backbone and incrementally allocates lightweight task-specific adapters and classifier heads. A latent task selector operates on task-adapted features and leverages both current and historical context preserved through compact prototypes and feature-level experience replay. This design supports stable task identification and adaptation across sequential updates while avoiding raw-image storage. Experiments on large-scale public chest radiograph datasets demonstrate robust performance retention and reliable task-aware inference under continual dataset ingestion. CARL-XRay outperforms joint training under task-unknown deployment, achieving higher routing accuracy (75.0\% vs.\ 62.5\%), while maintaining competitive diagnostic performance with AUROC of 0.74 in the oracle setting with ground-truth task identity and 0.75 under task-unknown inference, using significantly fewer trainable parameters. Finally, the proposed framework provides a practical alternative to joint training and repeated full retraining in continual clinical deployment.

Abstract: Sketching is inherently a sequential process, in which strokes are drawn in a meaningful order to explore and refine ideas. However, most generative models treat sketches as static images, overlooking the temporal structure that underlies creative drawing. We present a data-efficient approach for sequential sketch generation that adapts pretrained text-to-video diffusion models to generate sketching processes. Our key insight is that large language models and video diffusion models offer complementary strengths for this task: LLMs provide semantic planning and stroke ordering, while video diffusion models serve as strong renderers that produce high-quality, temporally coherent visuals. We leverage this by representing sketches as short videos in which strokes are progressively drawn on a blank canvas, guided by text-specified ordering instructions. We introduce a two-stage fine-tuning strategy that decouples the learning of stroke ordering from the learning of sketch appearance. Stroke ordering is learned using synthetic shape compositions with controlled temporal structure, while visual appearance is distilled from as few as seven manually authored sketching processes that capture both global drawing order and the continuous formation of individual strokes. Despite the extremely limited amount of human-drawn sketch data, our method generates high-quality sequential sketches that closely follow text-specified orderings while exhibiting rich visual detail. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach through extensions such as brush style conditioning and autoregressive sketch generation, enabling additional controllability and interactive, collaborative drawing.

Abstract: Gliomas, among the most common primary brain tumors, vary widely in aggressiveness, prognosis, and histology, making treatment challenging due to complex and time-intensive surgical interventions. This study presents an Attention-Gated Recurrent Residual U-Net (R2U-Net) based Triplanar (2.5D) model for improved brain tumor segmentation. The proposed model enhances feature representation and segmentation accuracy by integrating residual, recurrent, and triplanar architectures while maintaining computational efficiency, potentially aiding in better treatment planning. The proposed method achieves a Dice Similarity Score (DSC) of 0.900 for Whole Tumor (WT) segmentation on the BraTS2021 validation set, demonstrating performance comparable to leading models. Additionally, the triplanar network extracts 64 features per planar model for survival days prediction, which are reduced to 28 using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This approach achieves an accuracy of 45.71%, a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 108,318.128, and a Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRC) of 0.338 on the test dataset.

Abstract: We introduce ResearchGym, a benchmark and execution environment for evaluating AI agents on end-to-end research. To instantiate this, we repurpose five oral and spotlight papers from ICML, ICLR, and ACL. From each paper's repository, we preserve the datasets, evaluation harness, and baseline implementations but withhold the paper's proposed method. This results in five containerized task environments comprising 39 sub-tasks in total. Within each environment, agents must propose novel hypotheses, run experiments, and attempt to surpass strong human baselines on the paper's metrics. In a controlled evaluation of an agent powered by GPT-5, we observe a sharp capability--reliability gap. The agent improves over the provided baselines from the repository in just 1 of 15 evaluations (6.7%) by 11.5%, and completes only 26.5% of sub-tasks on average. We identify recurring long-horizon failure modes, including impatience, poor time and resource management, overconfidence in weak hypotheses, difficulty coordinating parallel experiments, and hard limits from context length. Yet in a single run, the agent surpasses the solution of an ICML 2025 Spotlight task, indicating that frontier agents can occasionally reach state-of-the-art performance, but do so unreliably. We additionally evaluate proprietary agent scaffolds including Claude Code (Opus-4.5) and Codex (GPT-5.2) which display a similar gap. ResearchGym provides infrastructure for systematic evaluation and analysis of autonomous agents on closed-loop research.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a widely adopted technique for transferring capabilities from LLMs to smaller, more efficient student models. However, unauthorized use of knowledge distillation takes unfair advantage of the considerable effort and cost put into developing frontier models. We investigate methods for modifying teacher-generated reasoning traces to achieve two objectives that deter unauthorized distillation: (1) \emph{anti-distillation}, or degrading the training usefulness of query responses, and (2) \emph{API watermarking}, which embeds verifiable signatures in student models. We introduce several approaches for dynamically rewriting a teacher's reasoning outputs while preserving answer correctness and semantic coherence. Two of these leverage the rewriting capabilities of LLMs, while others use gradient-based techniques. Our experiments show that a simple instruction-based rewriting approach achieves a strong anti-distillation effect while maintaining or even improving teacher performance. Furthermore, we show that our rewriting approach also enables highly reliable watermark detection with essentially no false alarms.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used to reason over content they were not trained on, such as new documents, evolving knowledge, and user-specific data. A common approach is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which stores verbatim documents externally (as chunks) and retrieves only a relevant subset at inference time for an LLM to reason over. However, this results in inefficient usage of test-time compute (LLM repeatedly reasons over the same documents); moreover, chunk retrieval can inject irrelevant context that increases unsupported generation. We propose a human-like non-parametric continual learning framework, where the base model remains fixed, and learning occurs by integrating each new experience into an external semantic memory state that accumulates and consolidates itself continually. We present Panini, which realizes this by representing documents as Generative Semantic Workspaces (GSW) -- an entity- and event-aware network of question-answer (QA) pairs, sufficient for an LLM to reconstruct the experienced situations and mine latent knowledge via reasoning-grounded inference chains on the network. Given a query, Panini only traverses the continually-updated GSW (not the verbatim documents or chunks), and retrieves the most likely inference chains. Across six QA benchmarks, Panini achieves the highest average performance, 5%-7% higher than other competitive baselines, while using 2-30x fewer answer-context tokens, supports fully open-source pipelines, and reduces unsupported answers on curated unanswerable queries. The results show that efficient and accurate structuring of experiences at write time -- as achieved by the GSW framework -- yields both efficiency and reliability gains at read time. Code is available at https://github.com/roychowdhuryresearch/gsw-memory.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for ontological heterogeneity that draws heavily from Carnapian-Goguenism, as presented by Kutz, Mossakowski and Lücke (2010). The approach is provisionally designated da Costian-Tarskianism, named after da Costa's Principle of Tolerance in Mathematics and after Alfred Tarski's work on the concept of a consequence operator. The approach is based on the machinery of consequence systems, as developed by Carnielli et al. (2008) and Citkin and Muravitsky (2022), and it introduces the idea of an extended consequence system, which is a consequence system extended with ontological axioms. The paper also defines the concept of an extended development graph, which is a graph structure that allows ontologies to be related via morphisms of extended consequence systems, and additionally via other operations such as fibring and splitting. Finally, we discuss the implications of this approach for the field of applied ontology and suggest directions for future research.

Abstract: The use of large language models either as decision support systems, or in agentic workflows, is rapidly transforming the digital ecosystem. However, the understanding of LLM decision-making under uncertainty remains limited. We initiate a comparative study of LLM risky choices along two dimensions: (1) prospect representation (explicit vs. experience based) and (2) decision rationale (explanation). Our study, which involves 20 frontier and open LLMs, is complemented by a matched human subjects experiment, which provides one reference point, while an expected payoff maximizing rational agent model provides another. We find that LLMs cluster into two categories: reasoning models (RMs) and conversational models (CMs). RMs tend towards rational behavior, are insensitive to the order of prospects, gain/loss framing, and explanations, and behave similarly whether prospects are explicit or presented via experience history. CMs are significantly less rational, slightly more human-like, sensitive to prospect ordering, framing, and explanation, and exhibit a large description-history gap. Paired comparisons of open LLMs suggest that a key factor differentiating RMs and CMs is training for mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a secure wireless agentic AI network comprising one supervisor AI agent and multiple other AI agents to provision quality of service (QoS) for users' reasoning tasks while ensuring confidentiality of private knowledge and reasoning outcomes. Specifically, the supervisor AI agent can dynamically assign other AI agents to participate in cooperative reasoning, while the unselected AI agents act as friendly jammers to degrade the eavesdropper's interception performance. To extend the service duration of AI agents, an energy minimization problem is formulated that jointly optimizes AI agent selection, base station (BS) beamforming, and AI agent transmission power, subject to latency and reasoning accuracy constraints. To address the formulated problem, we propose two resource allocation schemes, ASC and LAW, which first decompose it into three sub-problems. Specifically, ASC optimizes each sub-problem iteratively using the proposed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and successive convex approximation (SCA), while LAW tackles each sub-problem using the proposed large language model (LLM) optimizer within an agentic workflow. The experimental results show that the proposed solutions can reduce network energy consumption by up to 59.1% compared to other benchmark schemes. Furthermore, the proposed schemes are validated using a practical agentic AI system based on Qwen, demonstrating satisfactory reasoning accuracy across various public benchmarks.

Abstract: Invoice or payment dilution is the gap between the approved invoice amount and the actual collection is a significant source of non credit risk and margin loss in supply chain finance. Traditionally, this risk is managed through the buyer's irrevocable payment undertaking (IPU), which commits to full payment without deductions. However, IPUs can hinder supply chain finance adoption, particularly among sub-invested grade buyers. A newer, data-driven methods use real-time dynamic credit limits, projecting dilution for each buyer-supplier pair in real-time. This paper introduces an AI, machine learning framework and evaluates how that can supplement a deterministic algorithm to predict invoice dilution using extensive production dataset across nine key transaction fields.

Abstract: Generating realistic synthetic populations is essential for agent-based models (ABM) in transportation and urban planning. Current methods face two major limitations. First, many rely on a single dataset or follow a sequential data fusion and generation process, which means they fail to capture the complex interplay between features. Second, these approaches struggle with sampling zeros (valid but unobserved attribute combinations) and structural zeros (infeasible combinations due to logical constraints), which reduce the diversity and feasibility of the generated data. This study proposes a novel method to simultaneously integrate and synthesize multi-source datasets using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with gradient penalty. This joint learning method improves both the diversity and feasibility of synthetic data by defining a regularization term (inverse gradient penalty) for the generator loss function. For the evaluation, we implement a unified evaluation metric for similarity, and place special emphasis on measuring diversity and feasibility through recall, precision, and the F1 score. Results show that the proposed joint approach outperforms the sequential baseline, with recall increasing by 7\% and precision by 15\%. Additionally, the regularization term further improves diversity and feasibility, reflected in a 10\% increase in recall and 1\% in precision. We assess similarity distributions using a five-metric score. The joint approach performs better overall, and reaches a score of 88.1 compared to 84.6 for the sequential method. Since synthetic populations serve as a key input for ABM, this multi-source generative approach has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of ABM.

Abstract: We explore how different types and uses of memory can aid spatial navigation in changing uncertain environments. In the simple foraging task we study, every day, our agent has to find its way from its home, through barriers, to food. Moreover, the world is non-stationary: from day to day, the location of the barriers and food may change, and the agent's sensing such as its location information is uncertain and very limited. Any model construction, such as a map, and use, such as planning, needs to be robust against these challenges, and if any learning is to be useful, it needs to be adequately fast. We look at a range of strategies, from simple to sophisticated, with various uses of memory and learning. We find that an architecture that can incorporate multiple strategies is required to handle (sub)tasks of a different nature, in particular for exploration and search, when food location is not known, and for planning a good path to a remembered (likely) food location. An agent that utilizes non-stationary probability learning techniques to keep updating its (episodic) memories and that uses those memories to build maps and plan on the fly (imperfect maps, i.e. noisy and limited to the agent's experience) can be increasingly and substantially more efficient than the simpler (minimal-memory) agents, as the task difficulties such as distance to goal are raised, as long as the uncertainty, from localization and change, is not too large.

Abstract: We present Experiment Automation Agents (EAA), a vision-language-model-driven agentic system designed to automate complex experimental microscopy workflows. EAA integrates multimodal reasoning, tool-augmented action, and optional long-term memory to support both autonomous procedures and interactive user-guided measurements. Built on a flexible task-manager architecture, the system enables workflows ranging from fully agent-driven automation to logic-defined routines that embed localized LLM queries. EAA further provides a modern tool ecosystem with two-way compatibility for Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing instrument-control tools to be consumed or served across applications. We demonstrate EAA at an imaging beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, including automated zone plate focusing, natural language-described feature search, and interactive data acquisition. These results illustrate how vision-capable agents can enhance beamline efficiency, reduce operational burden, and lower the expertise barrier for users.

Abstract: Foundation models for agriculture are increasingly trained on massive spatiotemporal data (e.g., multi-spectral remote sensing, soil grids, and field-level management logs) and achieve strong performance on forecasting and monitoring. However, these models lack language-based reasoning and interactive capabilities, limiting their usefulness in real-world agronomic workflows. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting and generating text, but cannot directly reason over high-dimensional, heterogeneous agricultural datasets. We bridge this gap with an agentic framework for agricultural science. It provides a Python execution environment, AgriWorld, exposing unified tools for geospatial queries over field parcels, remote-sensing time-series analytics, crop growth simulation, and task-specific predictors (e.g., yield, stress, and disease risk). On top of this environment, we design a multi-turn LLM agent, Agro-Reflective, that iteratively writes code, observes execution results, and refines its analysis via an execute-observe-refine loop. We introduce AgroBench, with scalable data generation for diverse agricultural QA spanning lookups, forecasting, anomaly detection, and counterfactual "what-if" analysis. Experiments outperform text-only and direct tool-use baselines, validating execution-driven reflection for reliable agricultural reasoning.

Abstract: Web agents based on large language models have demonstrated promising capability in automating web tasks. However, current web agents struggle to reason out sensible actions due to the limitations of predicting environment changes, and might not possess comprehensive awareness of execution risks, prematurely performing risky actions that cause losses and lead to task failure. To address these challenges, we propose WAC, a web agent that integrates model collaboration, consequence simulation, and feedback-driven action refinement. To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain. A world model, specialized in environmental state transitions, simulates action outcomes, which a judge model then scrutinizes to trigger action corrective feedback when necessary. Experiments show that WAC achieves absolute gains of 1.8% on VisualWebArena and 1.3% on Online-Mind2Web.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in production environments face a fundamental safety-utility trade-off either a strict filtering mechanisms prevent harmful outputs but often block benign queries or a relaxed controls risk unsafe content generation. Conventional guardrails based on static rules or fixed confidence thresholds are typically context-insensitive and computationally expensive, resulting in high latency and degraded user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce an adaptive abstention system that dynamically adjusts safety thresholds based on real-time contextual signals such as domain and user history. The proposed framework integrates a multi-dimensional detection architecture composed of five parallel detectors, combined through a hierarchical cascade mechanism to optimize both speed and precision. The cascade design reduces unnecessary computation by progressively filtering queries, achieving substantial latency improvements compared to non-cascaded models and external guardrail systems. Extensive evaluation on mixed and domain-specific workloads demonstrates significant reductions in false positives, particularly in sensitive domains such as medical advice and creative writing. The system maintains high safety precision and near-perfect recall under strict operating modes. Overall, our context-aware abstention framework effectively balances safety and utility while preserving performance, offering a scalable solution for reliable LLM deployment.

Abstract: Contrary to common belief, common belief is not KD4.
  If individual belief is KD45, common belief does indeed lose the 5 property and keep the D and 4 properties -- and it has none of the other commonly considered properties of knowledge and belief. But it has another property: $C(Cφ\rightarrow φ)$ -- corresponding to so-called shift-reflexivity (reflexivity one step ahead). This observation begs the question:
  is KD4 extended with this axiom a complete characterisation of common belief in the KD45 case? If not, what \emph{is} the logic of common belief? In this paper we show that the answer to the first question is ``no'': there is one additional axiom, and, furthermore, it relies on the number of agents. We show that the result is a complete characterisation of common belief, settling the open problem.

Abstract: This work introduces EduEVAL-DB, a dataset based on teacher roles designed to support the evaluation and training of automatic pedagogical evaluators and AI tutors for instructional explanations. The dataset comprises 854 explanations corresponding to 139 questions from a curated subset of the ScienceQA benchmark, spanning science, language, and social science across K-12 grade levels. For each question, one human-teacher explanation is provided and six are generated by LLM-simulated teacher roles. These roles are inspired by instructional styles and shortcomings observed in real educational practice and are instantiated via prompt engineering. We further propose a pedagogical risk rubric aligned with established educational standards, operationalizing five complementary risk dimensions: factual correctness, explanatory depth and completeness, focus and relevance, student-level appropriateness, and ideological bias. All explanations are annotated with binary risk labels through a semi-automatic process with expert teacher review. Finally, we present preliminary validation experiments to assess the suitability of EduEVAL-DB for evaluation. We benchmark a state-of-the-art education-oriented model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) against a lightweight local Llama 3.1 8B model and examine whether supervised fine-tuning on EduEVAL-DB supports pedagogical risk detection using models deployable on consumer hardware.

Abstract: The LLM community often reports benchmark results as if they are synonymous with general model capabilities. However, benchmarks can have problems that distort performance, like test set contamination and annotator error. How can we know that a benchmark is a reliable indicator of some capability that we want to measure? This question concerns the construct validity of LLM benchmarks, and it requires separating benchmark results from capabilities when we model and predict LLM performance.
  Both social scientists and computer scientists propose formal models - latent factor models and scaling laws - for identifying the capabilities underlying benchmark scores. However, neither technique is satisfactory for construct validity. Latent factor models ignore scaling laws, and as a result, the capabilities they extract often proxy model size. Scaling laws ignore measurement error, and as a result, the capabilities they extract are both uninterpretable and overfit to the observed benchmarks.
  This thesis presents the structured capabilities model, the first model to extract interpretable and generalisable capabilities from a large collection of LLM benchmark results. I fit this model and its two alternatives on a large sample of results from the OpenLLM Leaderboard. Structured capabilities outperform latent factor models on parsimonious fit indices, and exhibit better out-of-distribution benchmark prediction than scaling laws. These improvements are possible because neither existing approach separates model scale from capabilities in the appropriate way. Model scale should inform capabilities, as in scaling laws, and these capabilities should inform observed results up to measurement error, as in latent factor models. In combining these two insights, structured capabilities demonstrate better explanatory and predictive power for quantifying construct validity in LLM evaluations.

Abstract: The Personal AI landscape is currently dominated by "Black Box" Retrieval-Augmented Generation. While standard vector databases offer statistical matching, they suffer from a fundamental lack of accountability: when an AI hallucinates or retrieves sensitive data, the user cannot inspect the cause nor correct the error. Worse, "deleting" a concept from a vector space is mathematically imprecise, leaving behind probabilistic "ghosts" that violate true privacy. We propose Ruva, the first "Glass Box" architecture designed for Human-in-the-Loop Memory Curation. Ruva grounds Personal AI in a Personal Knowledge Graph, enabling users to inspect what the AI knows and to perform precise redaction of specific facts. By shifting the paradigm from Vector Matching to Graph Reasoning, Ruva ensures the "Right to be Forgotten." Users are the editors of their own lives; Ruva hands them the pen. The project and the demo video are available at http://sisinf00.poliba.it/ruva/.

Abstract: When a multimodal Transformer answers a visual question, is the prediction driven by visual evidence, linguistic reasoning, or genuinely fused cross-modal computation -- and how does this structure evolve across layers? We address this question with a layer-wise framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that decomposes the predictive information at each Transformer layer into redundant, vision-unique, language-unique, and synergistic components. To make PID tractable for high-dimensional neural representations, we introduce \emph{PID Flow}, a pipeline combining dimensionality reduction, normalizing-flow Gaussianization, and closed-form Gaussian PID estimation. Applying this framework to LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.6-7B across six GQA reasoning tasks, we uncover a consistent \emph{modal transduction} pattern: visual-unique information peaks early and decays with depth, language-unique information surges in late layers to account for roughly 82\% of the final prediction, and cross-modal synergy remains below 2\%. This trajectory is highly stable across model variants (layer-wise correlations $>$0.96) yet strongly task-dependent, with semantic redundancy governing the detailed information fingerprint. To establish causality, we perform targeted Image$\rightarrow$Question attention knockouts and show that disrupting the primary transduction pathway induces predictable increases in trapped visual-unique information, compensatory synergy, and total information cost -- effects that are strongest in vision-dependent tasks and weakest in high-redundancy tasks. Together, these results provide an information-theoretic, causal account of how vision becomes language in multimodal Transformers, and offer quantitative guidance for identifying architectural bottlenecks where modality-specific information is lost.

Abstract: Cumulative constraints are central in scheduling with constraint programming, yet propagation is typically performed per constraint, missing multi-resource interactions and causing severe slowdowns on some benchmarks. I present a preprocessing method for inferring additional cumulative constraints that capture such interactions without search-time probing. This approach interprets cumulative constraints as linear inequalities over occupancy vectors and generates valid inequalities by (i) discovering covers, the sets of tasks that cannot run in parallel, (ii) strengthening the cover inequalities for the discovered sets with lifting, and (iii) injecting the resulting constraints back into the scheduling problem instance. Experiments on standard RCPSP and RCPSP/max test suites show that these inferred constraints improve search performance and tighten objective bounds on favorable instances, while incurring little degradation on unfavorable ones. Additionally, these experiments discover 25 new lower bounds and five new best solutions; eight of the lower bounds are obtained directly from the inferred constraints.

Abstract: Foundation models, including vision language models, are increasingly used in automated driving to interpret scenes, recommend actions, and generate natural language explanations. However, existing evaluation methods primarily assess outcome based performance, such as safety and trajectory accuracy, without determining whether model decisions reflect human relevant considerations. As a result, it remains unclear whether explanations produced by such models correspond to genuine reason responsive decision making or merely post hoc rationalizations. This limitation is especially significant in safety critical domains because it can create false confidence. To address this gap, we propose CARE Drive, Context Aware Reasons Evaluation for Driving, a model agnostic framework for evaluating reason responsiveness in vision language models applied to automated driving. CARE Drive compares baseline and reason augmented model decisions under controlled contextual variation to assess whether human reasons causally influence decision behavior. The framework employs a two stage evaluation process. Prompt calibration ensures stable outputs. Systematic contextual perturbation then measures decision sensitivity to human reasons such as safety margins, social pressure, and efficiency constraints. We demonstrate CARE Drive in a cyclist overtaking scenario involving competing normative considerations. Results show that explicit human reasons significantly influence model decisions, improving alignment with expert recommended behavior. However, responsiveness varies across contextual factors, indicating uneven sensitivity to different types of reasons. These findings provide empirical evidence that reason responsiveness in foundation models can be systematically evaluated without modifying model parameters.

Abstract: Current methods for personality control in Large Language Models rely on static prompting or expensive fine-tuning, failing to capture the dynamic and compositional nature of human traits. We introduce PERSONA, a training-free framework that achieves fine-tuning level performance through direct manipulation of personality vectors in activation space. Our key insight is that personality traits appear as extractable, approximately orthogonal directions in the model's representation space that support algebraic operations. The framework operates through three stages: Persona-Base extracts orthogonal trait vectors via contrastive activation analysis; Persona-Algebra enables precise control through vector arithmetic (scalar multiplication for intensity, addition for composition, subtraction for suppression); and Persona-Flow achieves context-aware adaptation by dynamically composing these vectors during inference. On PersonalityBench, our approach achieves a mean score of 9.60, nearly matching the supervised fine-tuning upper bound of 9.61 without any gradient updates. On our proposed Persona-Evolve benchmark for dynamic personality adaptation, we achieve up to 91% win rates across diverse model families. These results provide evidence that aspects of LLM personality are mathematically tractable, opening new directions for interpretable and efficient behavioral control.

Abstract: Large language models achieve strong performance on many complex reasoning tasks, yet their accuracy degrades sharply on benchmarks that require compositional reasoning, including ARC-AGI-2, GPQA, MATH, BBH, and HLE. Existing methods improve reasoning by expanding token-level search through chain-of-thought prompting, self-consistency, or reinforcement learning, but they leave the model's latent representation space fixed. When the required abstraction is not already encoded in this space, performance collapses. We propose Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE), a framework that enables pretrained language models to modify their internal representation geometry during inference. RCE introduces dynamically generated low-rank concept subspaces that are spawned when representational inadequacy is detected, selected through a minimum description length criterion, merged when synergistic, and consolidated via constrained optimization to preserve stability. This process allows the model to construct new abstractions rather than recombining existing ones. We integrate RCE with Mistral-7B and evaluate it across compositional reasoning benchmarks. RCE yields 12-18 point gains on ARC-AGI-2, 8-14 point improvements on GPQA and BBH, and consistent reductions in depth-induced error on MATH and HLE.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In the realm of multi-agent systems, the challenge of \emph{partial observability} is a critical barrier to effective coordination and decision-making. Existing approaches, such as belief state estimation and inter-agent communication, often fall short. Belief-based methods are limited by their focus on past experiences without fully leveraging global information, while communication methods often lack a robust model to effectively utilize the auxiliary information they provide. To solve this issue, we propose Global State Diffusion Algorithm~(GlobeDiff) to infer the global state based on the local observations. By formulating the state inference process as a multi-modal diffusion process, GlobeDiff overcomes ambiguities in state estimation while simultaneously inferring the global state with high fidelity. We prove that the estimation error of GlobeDiff under both unimodal and multi-modal distributions can be bounded. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GlobeDiff achieves superior performance and is capable of accurately inferring the global state.

Abstract: A growing literature uses large language models (LLMs) as synthetic participants to generate cost-effective and nearly instantaneous responses in social science experiments. However, there is limited guidance on when such simulations support valid inference about human behavior. We contrast two strategies for obtaining valid estimates of causal effects and clarify the assumptions under which each is suitable for exploratory versus confirmatory research. Heuristic approaches seek to establish that simulated and observed human behavior are interchangeable through prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and other repair strategies designed to reduce LLM-induced inaccuracies. While useful for many exploratory tasks, heuristic approaches lack the formal statistical guarantees typically required for confirmatory research. In contrast, statistical calibration combines auxiliary human data with statistical adjustments to account for discrepancies between observed and simulated responses. Under explicit assumptions, statistical calibration preserves validity and provides more precise estimates of causal effects at lower cost than experiments that rely solely on human participants. Yet the potential of both approaches depends on how well LLMs approximate the relevant populations. We consider what opportunities are overlooked when researchers focus myopically on substituting LLMs for human participants in a study.

Abstract: Accurate representation of building semantics, encompassing both generic object types and specific subtypes, is essential for effective AI model training in the architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO) industry. Conventional encoding methods (e.g., one-hot) often fail to convey the nuanced relationships among closely related subtypes, limiting AI's semantic comprehension. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel training approach that employs large language model (LLM) embeddings (e.g., OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA) as encodings to preserve finer distinctions in building semantics. We evaluated the proposed method by training GraphSAGE models to classify 42 building object subtypes across five high-rise residential building information models (BIMs). Various embedding dimensions were tested, including original high-dimensional LLM embeddings (1,536, 3,072, or 4,096) and 1,024-dimensional compacted embeddings generated via the Matryoshka representation model. Experimental results demonstrated that LLM encodings outperformed the conventional one-hot baseline, with the llama-3 (compacted) embedding achieving a weighted average F1-score of 0.8766, compared to 0.8475 for one-hot encoding. The results underscore the promise of leveraging LLM-based encodings to enhance AI's ability to interpret complex, domain-specific building semantics. As the capabilities of LLMs and dimensionality reduction techniques continue to evolve, this approach holds considerable potential for broad application in semantic elaboration tasks throughout the AECO industry.

Abstract: We consider a class of optimization problems on the space of probability measures motivated by the mean-field approach to studying neural networks. Such problems can be solved by constructing continuous-time gradient flows that converge to the minimizer of the energy function under consideration, and then implementing discrete-time algorithms that approximate the flow. In this work, we focus on the Fisher-Rao gradient flow and we construct an interacting particle system that approximates the flow as its mean-field limit. We discuss the connection between the energy function, the gradient flow and the particle system and explain different approaches to smoothing out the energy function with an appropriate kernel in a way that allows for the particle system to be well-defined. We provide a rigorous proof of the existence and uniqueness of thus obtained kernelized flows, as well as a propagation of chaos result that provides a theoretical justification for using the corresponding kernelized particle systems as approximation algorithms in entropic mean-field optimization.

Abstract: We study semi Lagrangian approximation schemes for Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equations arising from finite horizon optimal control problems. Classical error estimates for these schemes include the term $\frac{1}{Δt}$ which leads to pessimistic convergence bounds and is not observed in numerical experiments. In this work, we provide improved error estimates under standard regularity assumptions on the dynamics, the running cost, and the final cost, assuming the presence of a positive discount factor. The new bound depends linearly on the time step, the spatial mesh size, and a measure of the temporal oscillation of the control, thus removing the mixed term appearing in previous analyses. The proof relies on a refined comparison between continuous and discrete cost functionals and on stability estimates for the controlled dynamics. Numerical experiments confirm first-order convergence in both space and time and suggest that the improved behavior persists even in the undiscounted case.

Abstract: Multidisciplinary engineering system design typically employs a sequential process, progressing from system dynamics to design variables and control. However, this process is inefficient and may lead to a suboptimal design. We propose formulating the optimal control and multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) problems as a single problem with linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control. We use the coupled adjoint method to compute the design variable derivatives, which are critical for gradient-based design optimization. The computational cost of the derivative computation using the adjoint method is independent of the number of design variables, making it suitable for large-scale problems. We show that the coupled adjoint can be solved indirectly and more efficiently by solving three smaller adjoint equations that leverage the feedforward structure of the problem. We demonstrate this new approach on two test problems: design optimization of a classic cart-pole problem and the aerodynamic shape of a quadrotor blade. For the quadrotor blade design problem, we reduce the control cost by 10% by optimizing the blade for a specific control task with a slight penalty in steady hovering power consumption.

Abstract: In this paper, we study pooling downstream beds across specialties in a stochastic operating room planning problem. The main sources of uncertainty are stochastic surgical durations and patients' lengths of stay. We developed a two-stage stochastic programming model where in the first stage we decide on 1) the number of non-shared ICU and ward beds to be allocated to each specialty, and 2) the allocation of surgeries to operating rooms during the planning horizon. In the second stage, we decide on 1) the number of shared beds in ICU and wards to be allocated to different specialties on each day during the planning horizon, 2) the surge capacity required to satisfy downstream service to patients, and 3) the overtime incurred in operating rooms. The proposed model aims at minimizing the total cost including the patients' waiting cost, postponement cost, overtime and fixed cost of operating rooms, and the cost of downstream surge capacity. We have implemented the proposed stochastic programming model in a sample average approximation framework. To enhance the efficiency of sample average approximation, we have developed a specialized algorithm that quickly solves the second-stage model for any given first-stage solution for a large number of scenarios. We have carried out extensive computational experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of several pooling policies for downstream beds and also the efficiency of the proposed sample average approximation algorithm. Moreover, we have performed an extensive sensitivity analysis of cost and stochastic parameters. Our results demonstrated that a full-sharing policy among different specialties in the downstream units enhance the functionality of the system by up to 19.53%. Moreover, the results indicated that the solutions obtained by the proposed stochastic model outperform those from the corresponding deterministic problem by 17.43% on average.

An explicit solution to this problem is obtained via a system of coupled parabolic equations. Based on these results, we propose an iterative numerical method to solve the coupled system.

Abstract: We study the problem of determining what data is required to solve a decision-making task when only partial information about the state of the world is available. Focusing on linear programs, we introduce a decision-focused notion of data informativeness that formalizes when a data set is sufficient to recover the optimal decision. Our notion abstracts away the notion of estimators (how data is used): it depends solely on the structure of the optimization task and the uncertainty. Our main result provides a geometric characterization of data sufficiency: a data set is sufficient if and only if, together with prior knowledge, it captures all cost directions that can change the optimal solution, given the task structure and the uncertainty set. Building on our characterization, we develop a tractable algorithm to determine minimal sufficient data sets under general data collection constraints. Taken together, our work introduces a principled framework for task-aware data collection. We demonstrate the approach in two applications: selecting where to conduct field experiments to inform infrastructure design and choosing which candidates to interview in order to make an optimal hiring decision. Our results illustrate that small, carefully selected data sets often suffice to determine the optimal decisions.

Abstract: The paper presents an approach to the construction of stabilizing feedback for strongly nonlinear systems. The class of systems of interest includes systems with drift which are affine in control and which cannot be stabilized by continuous state feedback. The approach is independent of the selection of a Lyapunov type function, but requires the solution of a nonlinear programming 'satisficing problem' stated in terms of the logarithmic coordinates of flows. As opposed to other approaches, point-to-point steering is not required to achieve asymptotic stability. Instead, the flow of the controlled system is required to intersect periodically a certain reachable set in the space of the logarithmic coordinates.

Abstract: We introduce a framework for stochastic games on large sparse graphs, covering continuous-time and discrete-time dynamic games as well as static games. Players are indexed by the vertices of simple, locally finite graphs, allowing both finite and countably infinite populations, with asymptotics described through local weak convergence of marked graphs. The framework allows path-dependent utility functionals that may be heterogeneous across players. Under a contraction condition, we prove existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibria and establish exponential decay of correlations with graph distance. We further show that global equilibria can be approximated by truncated local games, and can even be reconstructed exactly on subgraphs given information on their boundary. Finally, we prove convergence of Nash equilibria along locally weakly convergent graph sequences, including sequences sampled from hyperfinite unimodular random graphs.

Abstract: A mixed integer maximization problem involving several additional constraints defined with both a lower and an upper bound is considered. It is assumed that one of such constraints is more restrictive than the others. As it can be seen as a resource window constraint, it defines the so-called window-constrained problem. From a bi-objective perspective, a 2-phase algorithm, called BORWin, is devised. It stands for Bi-Objective Relaxation for Window-constrained problems. The first phase is generic for any window-constrained problem and provides a family of upper bounds based on a bi-objective relaxation of the additional constraints. It is shown that the latter bounds strongly relate to the Lagrangian dual bounds. The second phase is derived for a variant involving a graph structure, namely the window-constrained longest-path problem on an acyclic graph. The aim is to take advantage of the upper bounds to devise an efficient label extension algorithm. It is shown that complementary upper bounds could be derived to further improve performance in some special cases. A typical example is when the additional constraints have special knapsack structures. This is the case for the Hydro-Unit Commitment problem with a single plant (1-HUC). From numerical experiments for the 1-HUC, BOR-Win appears to be very efficient compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: We investigate an entropy-regularized reinforcement learning (RL) approach to optimal stopping problems motivated by real option models. Classical stopping rules are strict and non-randomized, limiting natural exploration in RL settings. To address this, we introduce entropy regularization, allowing randomized stopping policies that balance exploitation and exploration. We derive an explicit analytical solution to the regularized problem and prove convergence of the associated free boundary to the classical stopping threshold as the entropy vanishes. The regularized problem admits a natural formulation as a singular stochastic control problem. Building on this structure, we propose both model-based and model-free policy iteration algorithms to learn the optimal boundary. The model-free method operates without knowledge of system dynamics, using only trajectories from the stochastic environment. We establish convergence guarantees and illustrate strong numerical performance. This framework provides a principled and tractable approach for data-driven stopping problems under uncertainty.

Abstract: We study Bregman proximal augmented Lagrangian methods with second-order oracles for convex convex-composite optimization problems. The outer loop is an instance of the Bregman proximal point algorithm with relative errors in the sense of Solodov and Svaiter, applied to the KKT operator associated with the problem. Akin to classical Lagrange-Newton methods, including primal-dual interior point methods the Bregman proximal point algorithm repeatedly solves regularized KKT inclusions by minimizing a smooth Bregman augmented Lagrangian function, obtained after marginalizing out the multiplier variables. Thanks to non-Euclidean geometries the marginal function is generalized self-concordant and therefore within the regime of Newton's method which converges quadratically if the step-size in the outer proximal point loop is chosen carefully. The operator-theoretic viewpoint allows us to employ the framework of metric subregularity to derive fast rates for the outer loop, and eventually state a joint complexity bound. Important special cases of our framework are a proximal variant of the exponential multiplier method due to Tseng and Bertsekas and interior-point proximal augmented Lagrangian schemes closely related to those of Pougkakiotis and Gondzio.

Abstract: Nonconvexities in markets with discrete decisions and nonlinear constraints make efficient pricing challenging, often necessitating subsidies. A prime example is the unit commitment (UC) problem in electricity markets, where costly subsidies are commonly required. We propose a new pricing scheme for nonconvex markets with both discreteness and nonlinearity, by convexifying nonconvex structures through a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation and deriving prices from the relaxation's dual variables. When the choice set is bounded, we establish strong duality for the SDP, which allows us to extend the envelope theorem to the value function of the relaxation. This extension yields a marginal price signal for demand, which we use as our pricing mechanism. We demonstrate that under certain conditions-for instance, when the relaxation's right hand sides are linear in demand-the resulting lost opportunity cost is bounded by the relaxation's optimality gap. This result highlights the importance of achieving tight relaxations. The proposed framework applies to nonconvex electricity market problems, including for both direct current and alternating current UC. Our numerical experiments indicate that the SDP relaxations are often tight, reinforcing the effectiveness of the proposed pricing scheme. Across a suite of IEEE benchmark instances, the lost opportunity cost under our pricing scheme is, on average, 46% lower than that of the commonly used fixed-binary pricing scheme.

Abstract: Passkeys -- discoverable WebAuthn credentials synchronised across devices are widely promoted as the future of passwordless authentication. Built on the FIDO2 standard, they eliminate shared secrets and resist phishing while offering usability through platform credential managers. Since their introduction in 2022, major vendors have integrated passkeys into operating systems and browsers, and prominent websites have announced support. Yet the true extent of adoption across the broader web remains unknown.
  Measuring this is challenging because websites implement passkeys in heterogeneous ways. Some expose explicit ``Sign in with passkey'' buttons, others hide options under multi-step flows or rely on conditional mediation, and many adopt external mechanisms such as JavaScript libraries or OAuth-based identity providers. There is no standardised discovery endpoint, and dynamic, JavaScript-heavy pages complicate automated detection.
  This paper makes two contributions. First, we present Fidentikit, a browser-based crawler implementing 43 heuristics across five categories -- UI elements, DOM structures, WebAuthn API calls, network patterns, and library detection developed through iterative refinement over manual examination of 1,500 sites. Second, we apply Fidentikit to the top 100,000 Tranco-ranked domains, producing the first large-scale census of passkey adoption. Our results show adoption strongly correlates with site popularity and often depends on external identity providers rather than native implementations.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables distributed model training across edge devices while preserving data locality. This decentralized approach has emerged as a promising solution for collaborative learning on sensitive user data, effectively addressing the longstanding privacy concerns inherent in centralized systems. However, the decentralized nature of FL exposes new security vulnerabilities, especially backdoor attacks that threaten model integrity. To investigate this critical concern, this paper presents the Layer Smoothing Attack (LSA), a novel backdoor attack that exploits layer-specific vulnerabilities in neural networks. First, a Layer Substitution Analysis methodology systematically identifies backdoor-critical (BC) layers that contribute most significantly to backdoor success. Subsequently, LSA strategically manipulates these BC layers to inject persistent backdoors while remaining undetected by state-of-the-art defense mechanisms. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures and datasets demonstrate that LSA achieves a remarkably backdoor success rate of up to 97% while maintaining high model accuracy on the primary task, consistently bypassing modern FL defenses. These findings uncover fundamental vulnerabilities in current FL security frameworks, demonstrating that future defenses must incorporate layer-aware detection and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: An open measurement problem in IoT security is whether scan-observable network configurations encode population-level exposure risk beyond individual devices. An analysis of internet-exposed IoT endpoints using a controlled multi-country sample from Shodan Search and Shodan InternetDB, selecting 100 hosts identified via TCP port 7547 (TR-069/CWMP) and evenly distributed across the ten most represented countries. Hosts are enriched with scan-derived metadata and analyzed using feature-relevance assessment, cross-country comparisons of open and risky port exposure, and supervised classification of higher-risk exposure profiles. The analysis reveals consistent cross-country differences in exposure structure, with mean risky-port counts ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 per host, and achieves balanced accuracy of approximately 0.61 when classifying higher-risk exposure profiles.

Abstract: We study natural privacy filters, which enable the exact composition of differentially private (DP) mechanisms with adaptively chosen privacy characteristics. Earlier privacy filters consider only simple privacy parameters such as Rényi-DP or Gaussian DP parameters. Natural filters account for the entire privacy profile of every query, promising greater utility for a given privacy budget. We show that, contrary to other forms of DP, natural privacy filters are not free in general. Indeed, we show that only families of privacy mechanisms that are well-ordered when composed admit free natural privacy filters.

Abstract: Intellicise (Intelligent and Concise) wireless network is the main direction of the evolution of future mobile communication systems, a perspective now widely acknowledged across academia and industry. As a key technology within it, Agentic AI has garnered growing attention due to its advanced cognitive capabilities, enabled through continuous perception-memory-reasoning-action cycles. This paper first analyses the unique advantages that Agentic AI introduces to intellicise wireless networks. We then propose a structured taxonomy for Agentic AI-enhanced secure intellicise wireless networks. Building on this framework, we identify emerging security and privacy challenges introduced by Agentic AI and summarize targeted strategies to address these vulnerabilities. A case study further demonstrates Agentic AI's efficacy in defending against intelligent eavesdropping attacks. Finally, we outline key open research directions to guide future exploration in this field.

Abstract: Language models now routinely produce text that is difficult to distinguish from human writing, raising the need for robust tools to verify content provenance. Watermarking has emerged as a promising countermeasure, with existing work largely focused on model quality preservation and robust detection. However, current schemes provide limited protection against false attribution. We strengthen the notion of soundness by introducing two novel guarantees: unforgeability and recoverability. Unforgeability prevents adversaries from crafting false positives, texts that are far from any output from the watermarked model but are nonetheless flagged as watermarked. Recoverability provides an additional layer of protection: whenever a watermark is detected, the detector identifies the source text from which the flagged content was derived. Together, these properties strengthen content ownership by linking content exclusively to its generating model, enabling secure attribution and fine-grained traceability. We construct the first undetectable watermarking scheme that is robust, unforgeable, and recoverable with respect to substitutions (i.e., perturbations in Hamming metric). The key technical ingredient is a new cryptographic primitive called robust (or recoverable) digital signatures, which allow verification of messages that are close to signed ones, while preventing forgery of messages that are far from all previously signed messages. We show that any standard digital signature scheme can be boosted to a robust one using property-preserving hash functions (Boyle, LaVigne, and Vaikuntanathan, ITCS 2019).

Abstract: AI watermarking embeds invisible signals within images to provide provenance information and identify content as AI-generated. In this paper, we introduce MarkSweep, a novel watermark removal attack that effectively erases the embedded watermarks from AI-generated images without degrading visual quality. MarkSweep first amplifies watermark noise in high-frequency regions via edge-aware Gaussian perturbations and injects it into clean images for training a denoising network. This network then integrates two modules, the learnable frequency decomposition module and the frequency-aware fusion module, to suppress amplified noise and eliminate watermark traces. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that invisible watermarks are highly vulnerable to MarkSweep, which effectively removes embedded watermarks, reducing the bit accuracy of HiDDeN and Stable Signature watermarking schemes to below 67%, while preserving perceptual quality of AI-generated images.

Abstract: Cryptographic digests (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) are designed to provide exact identity. Any single-bit change in the input produces a completely different hash, which is ideal for integrity verification but limits their usefulness in many real-world tasks like threat hunting, malware analysis and digital forensics, where adversaries routinely introduce minor transformations. Similarity-based techniques address this limitation by enabling approximate matching, allowing related byte sequences to produce measurably similar fingerprints. Modern enterprises manage tens of thousands of endpoints with billions of files, making the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed techniques more important than ever in security applications. Security researchers have proposed a range of approaches, including similarity digests and locality-sensitive hashes (e.g., ssdeep, sdhash, TLSH), as well as more recent machine-learning-based methods that generate embeddings from file features. However, these techniques have largely been evaluated in isolation, using disparate datasets and evaluation criteria. This paper presents a systematic comparison of learning-based classification and similarity methods using large, publicly available datasets. We evaluate each method under a unified experimental framework with industry-accepted metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first reproducible study to benchmark these diverse learning-based similarity techniques side by side for real-world security workloads. Our results show that no single approach performs well across all dimensions; instead, each exhibits distinct trade-offs, indicating that effective malware analysis and threat-hunting platforms must combine complementary classification and similarity techniques rather than rely on a single method.

Abstract: We study the builder-driven MEV arbitrage on BNB Smart Chain (BSC). BSC's Proposer--Builder Separation (PBS) adopts a leaner design: only whitelisted builders can participate, blocks are produced at shorter intervals, and private order flow bypasses the public mempool. These features have long raised community concerns over centralization, which we empirically confirm by tracing arbitrage activity of the two dominant builders from May to November 2025. Within months, 48Club and Blockrazor produced over 96\% of blocks and captured about 92\% of MEV profits.
  We find that profits concentrate in short, low-hop arbitrage routes over wrapped tokens and stablecoins, and that block construction rapidly converges toward monopoly. Beyond concentration alone, our analysis reveals a structural source of inequality: BSC's short block interval and whitelisted PBS collapse the contestable window for MEV competition, amplifying latency advantages and excluding slower builders and searchers. MEV extraction on BSC is not only more centralized than on Ethereum, but also structurally more vulnerable to censorship and weakened fairness.

Abstract: We introduce SecCodeBench-V2, a publicly released benchmark for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) copilots' capabilities of generating secure code. SecCodeBench-V2 comprises 98 generation and fix scenarios derived from Alibaba Group's industrial productions, where the underlying security issues span 22 common CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) categories across five programming languages: Java, C, Python, Go, and Node.js. SecCodeBench-V2 adopts a function-level task formulation: each scenario provides a complete project scaffold and requires the model to implement or patch a designated target function under fixed interfaces and dependencies. For each scenario, SecCodeBench-V2 provides executable proof-of-concept (PoC) test cases for both functional validation and security verification. All test cases are authored and double-reviewed by security experts, ensuring high fidelity, broad coverage, and reliable ground truth. Beyond the benchmark itself, we build a unified evaluation pipeline that assesses models primarily via dynamic execution. For most scenarios, we compile and run model-generated artifacts in isolated environments and execute PoC test cases to validate both functional correctness and security properties. For scenarios where security issues cannot be adjudicated with deterministic test cases, we additionally employ an LLM-as-a-judge oracle. To summarize performance across heterogeneous scenarios and difficulty levels, we design a Pass@K-based scoring protocol with principled aggregation over scenarios and severity, enabling holistic and comparable evaluation across models. Overall, SecCodeBench-V2 provides a rigorous and reproducible foundation for assessing the security posture of AI coding assistants, with results and artifacts released at https://alibaba.github.io/sec-code-bench. The benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/alibaba/sec-code-bench.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how attackers can discover sensitive information embedded within databases by exploiting inference rules. We demonstrate the inadequacy of naively applied existing state of the art differential privacy (DP) models in safeguarding against such attacks. We introduce ontology aware differential privacy (Onto-DP), a novel extension of differential privacy paradigms built on top of any classical DP model by enriching it with semantic awareness. We show that this extension is a sufficient condition to adequately protect against attackers aware of inference rules.

Abstract: Self-evolving LLM agents update their internal state across sessions, often by writing and reusing long-term memory. This design improves performance on long-horizon tasks but creates a security risk: untrusted external content observed during a benign session can be stored as memory and later treated as instruction. We study this risk and formalize a persistent attack we call a Zombie Agent, where an attacker covertly implants a payload that survives across sessions, effectively turning the agent into a puppet of the attacker.
  We present a black-box attack framework that uses only indirect exposure through attacker-controlled web content. The attack has two phases. During infection, the agent reads a poisoned source while completing a benign task and writes the payload into long-term memory through its normal update process. During trigger, the payload is retrieved or carried forward and causes unauthorized tool behavior. We design mechanism-specific persistence strategies for common memory implementations, including sliding-window and retrieval-augmented memory, to resist truncation and relevance filtering. We evaluate the attack on representative agent setups and tasks, measuring both persistence over time and the ability to induce unauthorized actions while preserving benign task quality. Our results show that memory evolution can convert one-time indirect injection into persistent compromise, which suggests that defenses focused only on per-session prompt filtering are not sufficient for self-evolving agents.

Abstract: Federated learning security research has predominantly focused on backdoor threats from a minority of malicious clients that intentionally corrupt model updates. This paper challenges this paradigm by investigating a more pervasive and insidious threat: \textit{backdoor vulnerabilities from low-concentration poisoned data distributed across the datasets of benign clients.} This scenario is increasingly common in federated instruction tuning for language models, which often rely on unverified third-party and crowd-sourced data. We analyze two forms of backdoor data through real cases: 1) \textit{natural trigger (inherent features as implicit triggers)}; 2) \textit{adversary-injected trigger}. To analyze this threat, we model the backdoor implantation process from signal aggregation, proposing the Backdoor Signal-to-Noise Ratio to quantify the dynamics of the distributed backdoor signal. Extensive experiments reveal the severity of this threat: With just less than 10\% of training data poisoned and distributed across clients, the attack success rate exceeds 85\%, while the primary task performance remains largely intact. Critically, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art backdoor defenses, designed for attacks from malicious clients, are fundamentally ineffective against this threat. Our findings highlight an urgent need for new defense mechanisms tailored to the realities of modern, decentralized data ecosystems.

Abstract: Database-driven cognitive radio networks (DB-CRNs) enable dynamic spectrum sharing through geolocation databases but introduce critical security and privacy challenges, including mandatory location disclosure, susceptibility to location spoofing, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on centralized services. Existing approaches address these issues in isolation and lack a unified, regulation-compliant solution under realistic adversarial conditions. In this work, we present a unified security framework for DB-CRNs that simultaneously provides location privacy, user anonymity, verifiable location, and DoS resilience. Our framework, denoted as SLAPX, enables privacy-preserving spectrum queries using delegatable anonymous credentials, supports adaptive location verification without revealing precise user location, and mitigates DoS attacks through verifiable delay functions (VDFs) combined with RLRS-based rate limiting. Extensive cryptographic benchmarking and network simulations demonstrate that SLAPX achieves significantly lower latency and communication overhead than existing solutions while effectively resisting location spoofing and DoS attacks. These results show that SLAPX is practical and well-suited for secure next-generation DB-CRN deployments.

Abstract: A natural and informal approach to verifiable (or zero-knowledge) ML inference over floating-point data is: ``prove that each layer was computed correctly up to tolerance $δ$; therefore the final output is a reasonable inference result''. This short note gives a simple counterexample showing that this inference is false in general: for any neural network, we can construct a functionally equivalent network for which adversarially chosen approximation-magnitude errors in individual layer computations suffice to steer the final output arbitrarily (within a prescribed bounded range).

Abstract: Digital mapping of semantic features is essential for achieving interoperability between semantic communication and practical digital infrastructure. However, current research efforts predominantly concentrate on analog semantic communication with simplified channel models. To bridge these gaps, we develop a robust vector quantized-enabled digital semantic communication (VQ-DSC-R) system built upon orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission. Our work encompasses the framework design of VQ-DSC-R, followed by a comprehensive optimization study. Firstly, we design a Swin Transformer-based backbone for hierarchical semantic feature extraction, integrated with VQ modules that map the features into a shared semantic quantized codebook (SQC) for efficient index transmission. Secondly, we propose a differentiable vector quantization with adaptive noise-variance (ANDVQ) scheme to mitigate quantization errors in SQC, which dynamically adjusts the quantization process using K-nearest neighbor statistics, while exponential moving average mechanism stabilizes SQC training. Thirdly, for robust index transmission over multipath fading channel and noise, we develop a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to refine channel state information, and design an attention-based module to dynamically adapt to channel noise. The entire VQ-DSC-R system is optimized via a three-stage training strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate superiority of VQ-DSC-R over benchmark schemes, achieving high compression ratios and robust performance in practical scenarios.

Abstract: We propose GRAM-DIFF, a Gram-matrix-guided diffusion framework for semi-blind multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel estimation. Recent diffusion-based estimators leverage learned generative priors to improve pilot-based channel estimation; but they do not exploit second-order structural information estimated from data symbols. In practical systems, the channel Gram matrix can be estimated from received symbols and it provides realization-level information about channel subspace structure. The proposed method integrates a pre-trained angular-domain diffusion prior with two complementary guidance mechanisms: a novel Gram-matrix guidance term that enforces second-order consistency during the reverse diffusion process, and likelihood guidance from pilot observations. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-matched initialization and adaptive guidance scaling ensure stability and low inference latency. Simulations on 3GPP and QuaDRiGa channel models demonstrate consistent normalized mean-squared error (NMSE) improvements over deterministic diffusion baselines, achieving 4 to 6 dB SNR gains at an NMSE of 0.1 over the baseline in Fest et al. (2024). The framework exhibits graceful degradation under coherence-time constraints, smoothly reverting to likelihood-guided diffusion when data-based Gram estimates become unreliable.

Abstract: Mixture distributions are a workhorse model for multimodal data in information theory, signal processing, and machine learning. Yet even when each component density is simple, the differential entropy of the mixture is notoriously hard to compute because the mixture couples a logarithm with a sum. This paper develops a deterministic, closed-form toolkit for bounding and accurately approximating mixture entropy directly from component parameters. Our starting point is an information-theoretic channel viewpoint: the latent mixture label plays the role of an input, and the observation is the output. This viewpoint separates mixture entropy into an average within-component uncertainty plus an overlap term that quantifies how much the observation reveals about the hidden label. We then bound and approximate this overlap term using pairwise overlap integrals between component densities, yielding explicit expressions whenever these overlaps admit a closed form. A simple, family-dependent offset corrects the systematic bias of the Jensen overlap bound and is calibrated to be exact in the two limiting regimes of complete overlap and near-perfect separation. A final clipping step guarantees that the estimate always respects universal information-theoretic bounds. Closed-form specializations are provided for Gaussian, factorized Laplacian, uniform, and hybrid mixtures, and numerical experiments validate the resulting bounds and approximations across separation, dimension, number of components, and correlated covariances.

Abstract: This paper develops a tractable analytical channel model for first-hitting-time molecular communication systems under time-varying drift. While existing studies of nonstationary transport rely primarily on numerical solutions of advection--diffusion equations or parametric impulse-response fitting, they do not provide a closed-form description of trajectory-level arrival dynamics at absorbing boundaries. By adopting a change-of-measure formulation, we reveal a structural decomposition of the first-hitting-time density into a cumulative-drift displacement term and a stochastic boundary-flux modulation factor. This leads to an explicit analytical expression for the Corrected-Inverse-Gaussian (C-IG) density, extending the classical IG model to strongly nonstationary drift conditions while preserving constant-complexity evaluation. High-precision Monte Carlo simulations under both smooth pulsatile and abrupt switching drift profiles confirm that the proposed model accurately captures complex transport phenomena, including phase modulation, multi-pulse dispersion, and transient backflow. The resulting framework provides a physics-informed, computationally efficient channel model suitable for system-level analysis and receiver design in dynamic biological and molecular communication environments.

Abstract: Today we design wireless networks using mathematical models that govern communication in different propagation environments. We rely on measurement campaigns to deliver parametrized propagation models, and on the 3GPP standards process to optimize model-based performance, but as wireless networks become more complex this model-based approach is losing ground. Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are counting on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to transform wireless by increasing spectral efficiency, reducing signaling overhead, and enabling continuous network innovation through software upgrades. They may also be interested in new use cases like integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). All we need is an AI-native physical layer, so why not simply tailor the offline AI algorithms that have revolutionized image and natural language processing to the wireless domain? We argue that these algorithms rely on off-line training that is precluded by the sub-millisecond speeds at which the wireless interference environment changes. We present an alternative architecture, a universal neural receiver based on convolution, which governs transmit and receive signal processing of any signal in any part of the wireless spectrum. Our neural receiver is designed to invert convolution, and we separate the question of which convolution to invert from the actual deconvolution. The neural network that performs deconvolution is very simple, and we configure this network by setting weights based on domain knowledge. By telling our neural network what we know, we avoid extensive offline training. By developing a universal receiver, we hope to simplify discussions about the proper choice of waveform for different use cases in the international standards. Since the receiver architecture is largely independent of technologies introduced at the base station, we hope to increase the rate of innovation in wireless.

Abstract: Safety is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in real-world applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare. To address this, Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are commonly used to enforce safety constraints while optimizing performance. However, existing methods often suffer from significant safety violations or require a high sample complexity to generate near-optimal policies. We address two settings: relaxed feasibility, where small violations are allowed, and strict feasibility, where no violation is allowed. We propose a model-based primal-dual algorithm that balances regret and bounded constraint violations, drawing on techniques from online RL and constrained optimization. For relaxed feasibility, we prove that our algorithm returns an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy with $\varepsilon$-bounded violation with arbitrarily high probability, requiring $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{SAH^3}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ learning episodes, matching the lower bound for unconstrained MDPs. For strict feasibility, we prove that our algorithm returns an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy with zero violation with arbitrarily high probability, requiring $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{SAH^5}{\varepsilon^2ζ^2}\right)$ learning episodes, where $ζ$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant characterizing the size of the feasible region. This result matches the lower bound for learning CMDPs with access to a generative model.
  Our results demonstrate that learning CMDPs in an online setting is as easy as learning with a generative model and is no more challenging than learning unconstrained MDPs when small violations are allowed.

Abstract: In predictive maintenance of equipment, deep learning-based time series anomaly detection has garnered significant attention; however, pure deep learning approaches often fail to achieve sufficient accuracy on real-world data. This study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates 64-dimensional time series embeddings from Granite TinyTimeMixer with 28-dimensional statistical features based on domain knowledge for HVAC equipment anomaly prediction tasks. Specifically, we combine time series embeddings extracted from a Granite TinyTimeMixer encoder fine-tuned with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and 28 types of statistical features including trend, volatility, and drawdown indicators, which are then learned using a LightGBM gradient boosting classifier. In experiments using 64 equipment units and 51,564 samples, we achieved Precision of 91--95\% and ROC-AUC of 0.995 for anomaly prediction at 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day horizons. Furthermore, we achieved production-ready performance with a false positive rate of 1.1\% or less and a detection rate of 88--94\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the system for predictive maintenance applications. This work demonstrates that practical anomaly detection systems can be realized by leveraging the complementary strengths between deep learning's representation learning capabilities and statistical feature engineering.

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) are geometric deep learning models based on dynamical systems and flows generated by vector fields on manifolds. Despite numerous successful applications, particularly within the flow matching paradigm, all existing NODE models are fundamentally constrained to fixed-dimensional dynamics by the intrinsic nature of the manifold's dimension. In this paper, we extend NODEs to M-polyfolds (spaces that can simultaneously accommodate varying dimensions and a notion of differentiability) and introduce PolyNODEs, the first variable-dimensional flow-based model in geometric deep learning. As an example application, we construct explicit M-polyfolds featuring dimensional bottlenecks and PolyNODE autoencoders based on parametrised vector fields that traverse these bottlenecks. We demonstrate experimentally that our PolyNODE models can be trained to solve reconstruction tasks in these spaces, and that latent representations of the input can be extracted and used to solve downstream classification tasks. The code used in our experiments is publicly available at https://github.com/turbotage/PolyNODE .

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as promising surrogates for large 3D scientific simulations due to their ability to continuously model spatial and conditional fields, yet they face a critical fidelity-speed dilemma: deep MLPs suffer from high inference cost, while efficient embedding-based models lack sufficient expressiveness. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled Representation Refinement (DRR) architectural paradigm. DRR leverages a deep refiner network, alongside non-parametric transformations, in a one-time offline process to encode rich representations into a compact and efficient embedding structure. This approach decouples slow neural networks with high representational capacity from the fast inference path. We introduce DRR-Net, a simple network that validates this paradigm, and a novel data augmentation strategy, Variational Pairs (VP) for improving INRs under complex tasks like high-dimensional surrogate modeling. Experiments on several ensemble simulation datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art fidelity, while being up to 27$\times$ faster at inference than high-fidelity baselines and remaining competitive with the fastest models. The DRR paradigm offers an effective strategy for building powerful and practical neural field surrogates and \rev{INRs in broader applications}, with a minimal compromise between speed and quality.

Abstract: Learning from electronic health records (EHRs) time series is challenging due to irregular sam- pling, heterogeneous missingness, and the resulting sparsity of observations. Prior self-supervised meth- ods either impute before learning, represent missingness through a dedicated input signal, or optimize solely for imputation, reducing their capacity to efficiently learn representations that support clinical downstream tasks. We propose the Augmented-Intrinsic Dual-Masked Autoencoder (AID-MAE), which learns directly from incomplete time series by applying an intrinsic missing mask to represent naturally missing values and an augmented mask that hides a subset of observed values for reconstruction during training. AID-MAE processes only the unmasked subset of tokens and consistently outperforms strong baselines, including XGBoost and DuETT, across multiple clinical tasks on two datasets. In addition, the learned embeddings naturally stratify patient cohorts in the representation space.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are designed to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual capabilities, yet in this work we observe a surprising phenomenon: VLMs can outperform their underlying LLMs on purely text-only tasks, particularly in long-context information retrieval. To investigate this effect, we build a controlled synthetic retrieval task and find that a transformer trained only on text achieves perfect in-distribution accuracy but fails to generalize out of distribution, while subsequent training on an image-tokenized version of the same task nearly doubles text-only OOD performance. Mechanistic interpretability reveals that visual training changes the model's internal binding strategy: text-only training encourages positional shortcuts, whereas image-based training disrupts them through spatial translation invariance, forcing the model to adopt a more robust symbolic binding mechanism that persists even after text-only examples are reintroduced. We further characterize how binding strategies vary across training regimes, visual encoders, and initializations, and show that analogous shifts occur during pretrained LLM-to-VLM transitions. Our findings suggest that cross-modal training can enhance reasoning and generalization even for tasks grounded in a single modality.

Abstract: Recent advances in scientific machine learning (SciML) have enabled neural operators (NOs) to serve as powerful surrogates for modeling the dynamic evolution of physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). While existing approaches focus primarily on learning simulations from the target PDE, they often overlook more fundamental physical principles underlying these equations. Inspired by how numerical solvers are compatible with simulations of different settings of PDEs, we propose a multiphysics training framework that jointly learns from both the original PDEs and their simplified basic forms. Our framework enhances data efficiency, reduces predictive errors, and improves out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, particularly in scenarios involving shifts of physical parameters and synthetic-to-real transfer. Our method is architecture-agnostic and demonstrates consistent improvements in normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) across a wide range of 1D/2D/3D PDE problems. Through extensive experiments, we show that explicit incorporation of fundamental physics knowledge significantly strengthens the generalization ability of neural operators. We will release models and codes at https://sites.google.com/view/sciml-fundemental-pde.

Abstract: Post-training compression of Transformer models commonly relies on truncated singular value decomposition (SVD). However, enforcing a single shared subspace can degrade accuracy even at moderate compression. Sparse dictionary learning provides a more flexible union-of-subspaces representation, but existing approaches often suffer from iterative dictionary and coefficient updates. We propose COMPOT (Calibration-Optimized Matrix Procrustes Orthogonalization for Transformers), a training-free compression framework that uses a small calibration dataset to estimate a sparse weight factorization. COMPOT employs orthogonal dictionaries that enable closed-form Procrustes updates for the dictionary and analytical single-step sparse coding for the coefficients, eliminating iterative optimization. To handle heterogeneous layer sensitivity under a global compression budget, COMPOT further introduces a one-shot dynamic allocation strategy that adaptively redistributes layer-wise compression rates. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures and tasks show that COMPOT consistently delivers a superior quality-compression trade-off over strong low-rank and sparse baselines, while remaining fully compatible with post-training quantization for extreme compression. Code is available $\href{https://github.com/mts-ai/COMPOT}{here}$.

Abstract: Reward learning typically relies on a single feedback type or combines multiple feedback types using manually weighted loss terms. Currently, it remains unclear how to jointly learn reward functions from heterogeneous feedback types such as demonstrations, comparisons, ratings, and stops that provide qualitatively different signals. We address this challenge by formulating reward learning from multiple feedback types as Bayesian inference over a shared latent reward function, where each feedback type contributes information through an explicit likelihood. We introduce a scalable amortized variational inference approach that learns a shared reward encoder and feedback-specific likelihood decoders and is trained by optimizing a single evidence lower bound. Our approach avoids reducing feedback to a common intermediate representation and eliminates the need for manual loss balancing. Across discrete and continuous-control benchmarks, we show that jointly inferred reward posteriors outperform single-type baselines, exploit complementary information across feedback types, and yield policies that are more robust to environment perturbations. The inferred reward uncertainty further provides interpretable signals for analyzing model confidence and consistency across feedback types.

Abstract: This paper concerns the question of how AI systems encode semantic structure into the geometric structure of their representation spaces. The motivating observation of this paper is that the natural geometry of these representation spaces should reflect the way models use representations to produce behavior. We focus on the important special case of representations that define softmax distributions. In this case, we argue that the natural geometry is information geometry. Our focus is on the role of information geometry on semantic encoding and the linear representation hypothesis. As an illustrative application, we develop "dual steering", a method for robustly steering representations to exhibit a particular concept using linear probes. We prove that dual steering optimally modifies the target concept while minimizing changes to off-target concepts. Empirically, we find that dual steering enhances the controllability and stability of concept manipulation.

Abstract: Multilinguality is a core capability for modern foundation models, yet training high-quality multilingual models remains challenging due to uneven data availability across languages. A further challenge is the performance interference that can arise from joint multilingual training, commonly referred to as the "curse of multilinguality". We study multilingual data curation across thirteen languages and find that many reported regressions are not inherent to multilingual scaling but instead stem from correctable deficiencies in data quality and composition rather than fundamental capacity limits. In controlled bilingual experiments, improving data quality for any single language benefits others: curating English improves non-English performance in 12 of 13 languages, while curating non-English yields reciprocal improvements in English. Bespoke per-language curation produces substantially larger within-language improvements. Extending these findings to large-scale general-purpose training mixtures, we show that curated multilingual allocations comprising under 8% of total tokens remain remarkably effective. We operationalize this approach within an effort that produced a 20T-token pretraining corpus derived entirely from public sources. Models with 3B and 8B parameters trained on a 1T-token random subset achieve competitive multilingual accuracy with 4-10x fewer training FLOPs than strong public baselines, establishing a new Pareto frontier in multilingual performance versus compute. Moreover, these benefits extend to frontier model scale: the 20T-token corpus served as part of the pretraining dataset for Trinity Large (400B/A13B), which exhibits strong multilingual performance relative to its training FLOPs. These results show that targeted, per-language data curation mitigates multilingual interference and enables compute-efficient multilingual scaling.

Abstract: Reward models are central to large language model (LLM) post-training. However, past work has shown that they can reward spurious or undesirable attributes such as length, format, hallucinations, and sycophancy. In this work, we introduce and study the research problem of automatically finding reward model biases in natural language. We offer a simple approach of using an LLM to iteratively propose and refine candidate biases. Our method can recover known biases and surface novel ones: for example, we found that Skywork-V2-8B, a leading open-weight reward model, often mistakenly favors responses with redundant spacing and responses with hallucinated content. In addition, we show evidence that evolutionary iteration outperforms flat best-of-N search, and we validate the recall of our pipeline using synthetically injected biases. We hope our work contributes to further research on improving RMs through automated interpretability methods.

Abstract: For deploying foundation models, practitioners increasingly need prescriptive scaling laws: given a pre training compute budget, what downstream accuracy is attainable with contemporary post training practice, and how stable is that mapping as the field evolves? Using large scale observational evaluations with 5k observational and 2k newly sampled data on model performance, we estimate capability boundaries, high conditional quantiles of benchmark scores as a function of log pre training FLOPs, via smoothed quantile regression with a monotone, saturating sigmoid parameterization. We validate the temporal reliability by fitting on earlier model generations and evaluating on later releases. Across various tasks, the estimated boundaries are mostly stable, with the exception of math reasoning that exhibits a consistently advancing boundary over time. We then extend our approach to analyze task dependent saturation and to probe contamination related shifts on math reasoning tasks. Finally, we introduce an efficient algorithm that recovers near full data frontiers using roughly 20% of evaluation budget. Together, our work releases the Proteus 2k, the latest model performance evaluation dataset, and introduces a practical methodology for translating compute budgets into reliable performance expectations and for monitoring when capability boundaries shift across time.

Abstract: We address prediction problems on tabular categorical data, where each instance is defined by multiple categorical attributes, each taking values from a finite set. These attributes are often referred to as fields, and their categorical values as features. Such problems frequently arise in practical applications, including click-through rate prediction and social sciences. We introduce and analyze {tensorFM}, a new model that efficiently captures high-order interactions between attributes via a low-rank tensor approximation representing the strength of these interactions. Our model generalizes field-weighted factorization machines. Empirically, tensorFM demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, its low latency makes it well-suited for time-sensitive applications, such as online advertising.

Abstract: For a broad family of discriminative models that includes autoregressive language models, identifiability results imply that if two models induce the same conditional distributions, then their internal representations agree up to an invertible linear transformation. We ask whether an analogous conclusion holds approximately when the distributions are close instead of equal. Building on the observation of Nielsen et al. (2025) that closeness in KL divergence need not imply high linear representational similarity, we study a distributional distance based on logit differences and show that closeness in this distance does yield linear similarity guarantees. Specifically, we define a representational dissimilarity measure based on the models' identifiability class and prove that it is bounded by the logit distance. We further show that, when model probabilities are bounded away from zero, KL divergence upper-bounds logit distance; yet the resulting bound fails to provide nontrivial control in practice. As a consequence, KL-based distillation can match a teacher's predictions while failing to preserve linear representational properties, such as linear-probe recoverability of human-interpretable concepts. In distillation experiments on synthetic and image datasets, logit-distance distillation yields students with higher linear representational similarity and better preservation of the teacher's linearly recoverable concepts.

Abstract: Virtual screening aims to efficiently identify active ligands from massive chemical libraries for a given target pocket. Recent CLIP-style models such as DrugCLIP enable scalable virtual screening by embedding pockets and ligands into a shared space. However, our analyses indicate that such representations can be insensitive to fine-grained binding interactions and may rely on shortcut correlations in training data, limiting their ability to rank ligands by true binding compatibility. To address these issues, we propose BindCLIP, a unified contrastive-generative representation learning framework for virtual screening. BindCLIP jointly trains pocket and ligand encoders using CLIP-style contrastive learning together with a pocket-conditioned diffusion objective for binding pose generation, so that pose-level supervision directly shapes the retrieval embedding space toward interaction-relevant features. To further mitigate shortcut reliance, we introduce hard-negative augmentation and a ligand-ligand anchoring regularizer that prevents representation collapse. Experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. BindCLIP achieves substantial gains on challenging out-of-distribution virtual screening and improves ligand-analogue ranking on the FEP+ benchmark. Together, these results indicate that integrating generative, pose-level supervision with contrastive learning yields more interaction-aware embeddings and improves generalization in realistic screening settings, bringing virtual screening closer to real-world applicability.

Abstract: Stability and robustness are critical for deploying Transformers in safety-sensitive settings. A principled way to enforce such behavior is to constrain the model's Lipschitz constant. However, approximation-theoretic guarantees for architectures that explicitly preserve Lipschitz continuity have yet to be established. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a class of gradient-descent-type in-context Transformers that are Lipschitz-continuous by construction. We realize both MLP and attention blocks as explicit Euler steps of negative gradient flows, ensuring inherent stability without sacrificing expressivity. We prove a universal approximation theorem for this class within a Lipschitz-constrained function space. Crucially, our analysis adopts a measure-theoretic formalism, interpreting Transformers as operators on probability measures, to yield approximation guarantees independent of token count. These results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for the design of robust, Lipschitz continuous Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Adversarial training for LLMs is one of the most promising methods to reliably improve robustness against adversaries. However, despite significant progress, models remain vulnerable to simple in-distribution exploits, such as rewriting prompts in the past tense or translating them into other languages. We argue that this persistent fragility stems from a fundamental limitation in current adversarial training algorithms: they minimize adversarial loss on their training set but inadequately cover the data distribution, resulting in vulnerability to seemingly simple attacks. To bridge this gap, we propose Distributional Adversarial Training, DAT. We leverage Diffusion LLMs to approximate the true joint distribution of prompts and responses, enabling generation of diverse, high-likelihood samples that address generalization failures. By combining optimization over the data distribution provided by the diffusion model with continuous adversarial training, DAT achieves substantially higher adversarial robustness than previous methods.

Abstract: This paper provides statistical guarantees on the accuracy of dynamical models learned from dependent data sequences. Specifically, we develop uniform error bounds that apply to quantized models and imperfect optimization algorithms commonly used in practical contexts for system identification, and in particular hybrid system identification. Two families of bounds are obtained: slow-rate bounds via a block decomposition and fast-rate, variance-adaptive, bounds via a novel spaced-point strategy. The bounds scale with the number of bits required to encode the model and thus translate hardware constraints into interpretable statistical complexities.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across domains, motivating the rise of Graph Transformers (GTs) as attention-based architectures for graph-structured data. A key design choice in GTs is the use of Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based positional encodings to incorporate structural information. In this work, we study GTs through the lens of manifold limit models for graph sequences and establish a theoretical connection between GTs with GNN positional encodings and Manifold Neural Networks (MNNs). Building on transferability results for GNNs under manifold convergence, we show that GTs inherit transferability guarantees from their positional encodings. In particular, GTs trained on small graphs provably generalize to larger graphs under mild assumptions. We complement our theory with extensive experiments on standard graph benchmarks, demonstrating that GTs exhibit scalable behavior on par with GNNs. To further show the efficiency in a real-world scenario, we implement GTs for shortest path distance estimation over terrains to better illustrate the efficiency of the transferable GTs. Our results provide new insights into the understanding of GTs and suggest practical directions for efficient training of GTs in large-scale settings.

Abstract: Models based on partial differential equations (PDEs) are powerful for describing a wide range of complex relationships in the natural sciences. Accurately identifying the PDE model, which represents the underlying physical law, is essential for a proper understanding of the problem. This reconstruction typically relies on indirect and noisy measurements of the system's state and, without specifically tailored methods, rarely yields symbolic expressions, thereby hindering interpretability. In this work, we address this issue by considering existing neural network architectures based on rational functions for the symbolic representation of physical laws. These networks leverage the approximation power of rational functions while also benefiting from their flexibility in representing arithmetic operations. Our main contribution is an identifiability result, showing that, in the limit of noiseless, complete measurements, such symbolic networks can uniquely reconstruct the simplest physical law within the PDE model. Specifically, reconstructed laws remain expressible within the symbolic network architecture, with regularization-minimizing parameterizations promoting interpretability and sparsity in case of $L^1$-regularization. In addition, we provide regularity results for symbolic networks. Empirical validation using the ParFam architecture supports these theoretical findings, providing evidence for the practical reconstructibility of physical laws.

Abstract: Certified machine unlearning can be achieved via noise injection leading to differential privacy guarantees, where noise is calibrated to worst-case sensitivity. Such conservative calibration often results in performance degradation, limiting practical applicability. In this work, we investigate an alternative approach based on adaptive per-instance noise calibration tailored to the individual contribution of each data point to the learned solution. This raises the following challenge: how can one establish formal unlearning guarantees when the mechanism depends on the specific point to be removed? To define individual data point sensitivities in noisy gradient dynamics, we consider the use of per-instance differential privacy. For ridge regression trained via Langevin dynamics, we derive high-probability per-instance sensitivity bounds, yielding certified unlearning with substantially less noise injection. We corroborate our theoretical findings through experiments in linear settings and provide further empirical evidence on the relevance of the approach in deep learning settings.

Abstract: Neural scaling laws -- power-law relationships between loss, model size, and data -- have been extensively documented for language and vision transformers, yet their existence in single-cell genomics remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of scaling behaviour for masked-reconstruction transformers trained on single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Using expression profiles from the CELLxGENE Census, we construct two experimental regimes: a data-rich regime (512 highly variable genes, 200,000 cells) and a data-limited regime (1,024 genes, 10,000 cells). Across seven model sizes spanning three orders of magnitude in parameter count (533 to 3.4 x 10^8 parameters), we fit the parametric scaling law to validation mean squared error (MSE). The data-rich regime exhibits clear power-law scaling with an irreducible loss floor of c ~ 1.44, while the data-limited regime shows negligible scaling, indicating that model capacity is not the binding constraint when data are scarce. These results establish that scaling laws analogous to those observed in natural language processing do emerge in single-cell transcriptomics when sufficient data are available, and they identify the data-to-parameter ratio as a critical determinant of scaling behaviour. A preliminary conversion of the data-rich asymptotic floor to information-theoretic units yields an estimate of approximately 2.30 bits of entropy per masked gene position. We discuss implications for the design of single-cell foundation models and outline the additional measurements needed to refine this entropy estimate.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved strong results on high-dimensional control tasks, but applying RL to reachability problems raises a fundamental mismatch: reachability seeks to maximize the set of states from which a system remains safe indefinitely, while RL optimizes expected returns over a user-specified distribution. This mismatch can result in policies that perform poorly on low-probability states that are still within the safe set. A natural alternative is to frame the problem as a robust optimization over a set of initial conditions that specify the initial state, dynamics and safe set, but whether this problem has a solution depends on the feasibility of the specified set, which is unknown a priori. We propose Feasibility-Guided Exploration (FGE), a method that simultaneously identifies a subset of feasible initial conditions under which a safe policy exists, and learns a policy to solve the reachability problem over this set of initial conditions. Empirical results demonstrate that FGE learns policies with over 50% more coverage than the best existing method for challenging initial conditions across tasks in the MuJoCo simulator and the Kinetix simulator with pixel observations.

Abstract: On-policy distillation (OPD), which samples trajectories from the student model and supervises them with a teacher at the token level, avoids relying solely on verifiable terminal rewards and can yield better generalization than off-policy distillation. However, OPD requires expensive on-the-fly sampling of the student policy during training, which substantially increases training cost, especially for long responses. Our initial analysis shows that, during OPD, training signals are often concentrated in the prefix of each output, and that even a short teacher-generated prefix can significantly help the student produce the correct answer. Motivated by these observations, we propose a simple yet effective modification of OPD: we apply the distillation objective only to prefixes of student-generated outputs and terminate each sampling early during distillation. Experiments on a suite of AI-for-Math and out-of-domain benchmarks show that on-policy prefix distillation matches the performance of full OPD while reducing training FLOP by 2x-47x.

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks achieve high predictive accuracy but remain poorly calibrated: their confidence scores do not reliably reflect the true probability of correctness. We propose a quantum-inspired classification head architecture that projects backbone features into a complex-valued Hilbert space and evolves them under a learned unitary transformation parameterised via the Cayley map. Through a controlled hybrid experimental design - training a single shared backbone and comparing lightweight interchangeable heads - we isolate the effect of complex-valued unitary representations on calibration. Our ablation study on CIFAR-10 reveals that the unitary magnitude head (complex features evolved under a Cayley unitary, read out via magnitude and softmax) achieves an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.0146, representing a 2.4x improvement over a standard softmax head (0.0355) and a 3.5x improvement over temperature scaling (0.0510). Surprisingly, replacing the softmax readout with a Born rule measurement layer - the quantum-mechanically motivated approach - degrades calibration to an ECE of 0.0819. On the CIFAR-10H human-uncertainty benchmark, the wave function head achieves the lowest KL-divergence (0.336) to human soft labels among all compared methods, indicating that complex-valued representations better capture the structure of human perceptual ambiguity. We provide theoretical analysis connecting norm-preserving unitary dynamics to calibration through feature-space geometry, report negative results on out-of-distribution detection and sentiment analysis to delineate the method's scope, and discuss practical implications for safety-critical applications. Code is publicly available.

Abstract: Collaborative clinical decision support is often constrained by governance and privacy rules that prevent pooling patient-level records across institutions. We present a hybrid privacy-preserving framework that combines Federated Learning (FL) and Split Learning (SL) to support decision-oriented healthcare modeling without raw-data sharing. The approach keeps feature-extraction trunks on clients while hosting prediction heads on a coordinating server, enabling shared representation learning and exposing an explicit collaboration boundary where privacy controls can be applied. Rather than assuming distributed training is inherently private, we audit leakage empirically using membership inference on cut-layer representations and study lightweight defenses based on activation clipping and additive Gaussian noise. We evaluate across three public clinical datasets under non-IID client partitions using a unified pipeline and assess performance jointly along four deployment-relevant axes: factual predictive utility, uplift-based ranking under capacity constraints, audited privacy leakage, and communication overhead. Results show that hybrid FL-SL variants achieve competitive predictive performance and decision-facing prioritization behavior relative to standalone FL or SL, while providing a tunable privacy-utility trade-off that can reduce audited leakage without requiring raw-data sharing. Overall, the work positions hybrid FL-SL as a practical design space for privacy-preserving healthcare decision support where utility, leakage risk, and deployment cost must be balanced explicitly.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) relies almost exclusively on dense adaptive optimizers with increasingly sophisticated preconditioners. We challenge this by showing that randomly masking parameter updates can be highly effective, with a masked variant of RMSProp consistently outperforming recent state-of-the-art optimizers. Our analysis reveals that the random masking induces a curvature-dependent geometric regularization that smooths the optimization trajectory. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Momentum-aligned gradient masking (Magma), which modulates the masked updates using momentum-gradient alignment. Extensive LLM pre-training experiments show that Magma is a simple drop-in replacement for adaptive optimizers with consistent gains and negligible computational overhead. Notably, for the 1B model size, Magma reduces perplexity by over 19\% and 9\% compared to Adam and Muon, respectively.

Abstract: The long-tail distribution, where a few head labels dominate while rare tail labels abound, poses a persistent challenge for large-scale Multi-Label Classification (MLC) in real-world data mining applications. Existing resampling and reweighting strategies often disrupt inter-label dependencies or require brittle hyperparameter tuning, especially as the label space expands to tens of thousands of labels. To address this issue, we propose Curiosity-Driven Game-Theoretic Multi-Label Learning (CD-GTMLL), a scalable cooperative framework that recasts long-tail MLC as a multi-player game - each sub-predictor ("player") specializes in a partition of the label space, collaborating to maximize global accuracy while pursuing intrinsic curiosity rewards based on tail label rarity and inter-player disagreement. This mechanism adaptively injects learning signals into under-represented tail labels without manual balancing or tuning. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that our CD-GTMLL converges to a tail-aware equilibrium and formally links the optimization dynamics to improvements in the Rare-F1 metric. Extensive experiments across 7 benchmarks, including extreme multi-label classification datasets with 30,000+ labels, demonstrate that CD-GTMLL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, with gains up to +1.6% P@3 on Wiki10-31K. Ablation studies further confirm the contributions of both game-theoretic cooperation and curiosity-driven exploration to robust tail performance. By integrating game theory with curiosity mechanisms, CD-GTMLL not only enhances model efficiency in resource-constrained environments but also paves the way for more adaptive learning in imbalanced data scenarios across industries like e-commerce and healthcare.

Abstract: Understanding how language models carry out long-horizon reasoning remains an open challenge. Existing interpretability methods often highlight tokens or spans correlated with an answer, but they rarely reveal where the model makes consequential reasoning turns, which earlier context causally triggers those turns, or whether the highlighted text actually steers the reasoning process. We introduce Directional Reasoning Trajectory Change (DRTC), a process-causal framework for interpreting long-form reasoning from a single on-policy rollout. DRTC detects pivot decision points using uncertainty and distribution-shift signals, then applies receiver-side interventions that preserve the realized rollout without resampling the continuation while blocking information flow from selected earlier chunks only at a pivot. It measures whether each intervention redirects the direction of the model's log-probability trajectory relative to the realized rollout direction, producing a signed per-chunk attribution score. We also compute turning-angle curvature changes on raw logits as a complementary diagnostic and introduce curvature signatures to summarize shared intervention-response geometry. Empirically, directional influence is sharply concentrated across four reasoning models (per-example |DRTC| shares yield Gini 0.50 to 0.58 and top-5 percent mass 0.23 to 0.28), and learned pivots induce stronger intervention magnitudes than matched random spans. In a scaling study on 500 MATH problems with R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, learned spans outperform matched random spans (median delta = 0.409, 355 of 500 positive; sign test p = 2.3e-21). Overall, DRTC provides a causally grounded, trajectory-level view of how specific context elements steer reasoning under on-policy dynamics.

Abstract: Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) has emerged as a significant research area in recent years. By not waiting for slower clients and executing the training process concurrently, it achieves faster training speed compared to traditional federated learning. However, due to the staleness introduced by the asynchronous process, its performance may degrade in some scenarios. Existing methods often use the round difference between the current model and the global model as the sole measure of staleness, which is coarse-grained and lacks observation of the model itself, thereby limiting the performance ceiling of asynchronous methods. In this paper, we propose FedPSA (Parameter Sensitivity-based Asynchronous Federated Learning), a more fine-grained AFL framework that leverages parameter sensitivity to measure model obsolescence and establishes a dynamic momentum queue to assess the current training phase in real time, thereby adjusting the tolerance for outdated information dynamically. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and comparisons with various methods demonstrate the superior performance of FedPSA, achieving up to 6.37\% improvement over baseline methods and 1.93\% over the current state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment relies on complex reward signals that often obscure the specific behaviors being incentivized, creating critical risks of misalignment and reward hacking. Existing interpretation methods typically rely on pre-defined rubrics, risking the omission of "unknown unknowns", or fail to identify objectives that comprehensively cover and are causal to the model behavior. To address these limitations, we introduce Obj-Disco, a framework that automatically decomposes an alignment reward signal into a sparse, weighted combination of human-interpretable natural language objectives. Our approach utilizes an iterative greedy algorithm to analyze behavioral changes across training checkpoints, identifying and validating candidate objectives that best explain the residual reward signal. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks, model sizes, and alignment algorithms demonstrate the framework's robustness. Experiments with popular open-source reward models show that the framework consistently captures > 90% of reward behavior, a finding further corroborated by human evaluation. Additionally, a case study on alignment with an open-source reward model reveals that Obj-Disco can successfully identify latent misaligned incentives that emerge alongside intended behaviors. Our work provides a crucial tool for uncovering the implicit objectives in LLM alignment, paving the way for more transparent and safer AI development.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly augmented with long-term memory systems to overcome finite context windows and enable persistent reasoning across interactions. However, recent research finds that LLMs become more vulnerable because memory provides extra attack surfaces. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of black-box adversarial memory injection attacks that target the similarity-based retrieval mechanism in long-term memory-augmented LLMs. We introduce ER-MIA, a unified framework that exposes this vulnerability and formalizes two realistic attack settings: content-based attacks and question-targeted attacks. In these settings, ER-MIA includes an arsenal of composable attack primitives and ensemble attacks that achieve high success rates under minimal attacker assumptions. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and long-term memory systems demonstrate that similarity-based retrieval constitutes a fundamental and system-level vulnerability, revealing security risks that persist across memory designs and application scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved notable performance in high-dimensional sequential decision-making tasks, yet remains limited by low sample efficiency, sensitivity to noise, and weak generalization under partial observability. Most existing approaches address these issues primarily through optimization strategies, while the role of architectural priors in shaping representation learning and decision dynamics is less explored. Inspired by structural principles of the cerebellum, we propose a biologically grounded RL architecture that incorporate large expansion, sparse connectivity, sparse activation, and dendritic-level modulation. Experiments on noisy, high-dimensional RL benchmarks show that both the cerebellar architecture and dendritic modulation consistently improve sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization compared to conventional designs. Sensitivity analysis of architectural parameters suggests that cerebellum-inspired structures can offer optimized performance for RL with constrained model parameters. Overall, our work underscores the value of cerebellar structural priors as effective inductive biases for RL.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows remote clients to train a global model collaboratively while protecting client privacy. Despite its privacy-preserving benefits, FL has significant drawbacks, including slow convergence, high communication cost, and non-independent-and-identically-distributed (non-IID) data. In this work, we present a novel FedAvg variation called Fractional-Order Federated Averaging (FOFedAvg), which incorporates Fractional-Order Stochastic Gradient Descent (FOSGD) to capture long-range relationships and deeper historical information. By introducing memory-aware fractional-order updates, FOFedAvg improves communication efficiency and accelerates convergence while mitigating instability caused by heterogeneous, non-IID client data. We compare FOFedAvg against a broad set of established federated optimization algorithms on benchmark datasets including MNIST, FEMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, EMNIST, the Cleveland heart disease dataset, Sent140, PneumoniaMNIST, and Edge-IIoTset. Across a range of non-IID partitioning schemes, FOFedAvg is competitive with, and often outperforms, these baselines in terms of test performance and convergence speed. On the theoretical side, we prove that FOFedAvg converges to a stationary point under standard smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions for fractional order $0<α\le 1$. Together, these results show that fractional-order, memory-aware updates can substantially improve the robustness and effectiveness of federated learning, offering a practical path toward distributed training on heterogeneous data.

Abstract: Robust classification in noisy environments remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Standard approaches typically treat signal enhancement and classification as separate, sequential stages: first enhancing the signal and then applying a classifier. This approach fails to leverage the semantic information in the classifier's output during denoising. In this work, we propose a general, domain-agnostic framework that integrates two interacting diffusion models: one operating on the input signal and the other on the classifier's output logits, without requiring any retraining or fine-tuning of the classifier. This coupled formulation enables mutual guidance, where the enhancing signal refines the class estimation and, conversely, the evolving class logits guide the signal reconstruction towards discriminative regions of the manifold. We introduce three strategies to effectively model the joint distribution of the input and the logit. We evaluated our joint enhancement method for image classification and automatic speech recognition. The proposed framework surpasses traditional sequential enhancement baselines, delivering robust and flexible improvements in classification accuracy under diverse noise conditions.

Abstract: Sequential Social Dilemmas (SSDs) provide a key framework for studying how cooperation emerges when individual incentives conflict with collective welfare. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, these problems are often addressed by incorporating intrinsic drives that encourage prosocial or fair behavior. However, most existing methods assume that agents face identical incentives in the dilemma and require continuous access to global information about other agents to assess fairness. In this work, we introduce asymmetric variants of well-known SSD environments and examine how natural differences between agents influence cooperation dynamics. Our findings reveal that existing fairness-based methods struggle to adapt under asymmetric conditions by enforcing raw equality that wrongfully incentivize defection. To address this, we propose three modifications: (i) redefining fairness by accounting for agents' reward ranges, (ii) introducing an agent-based weighting mechanism to better handle inherent asymmetries, and (iii) localizing social feedback to make the methods effective under partial observability without requiring global information sharing. Experimental results show that in asymmetric scenarios, our method fosters faster emergence of cooperative policies compared to existing approaches, without sacrificing scalability or practicality.

Abstract: Integrating reasoning in large language models and large vision-language models has recently led to significant improvement of their capabilities. However, the generalization of reasoning models is still vaguely defined and poorly understood. In this work, we present an evaluation framework to rigorously examine how well chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches generalize on a simple planning task. Specifically, we consider a grid-based navigation task in which a model is provided with a map and must output a sequence of moves that guides a player from a start position to a goal while avoiding obstacles. The versatility of the task and its data allows us to fine-tune model variants using different input representations (visual and textual) and CoT reasoning strategies, and systematically evaluate them under both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test conditions. Our experiments show that, while CoT reasoning improves in-distribution generalization across all representations, out-of-distribution generalization (e.g., to larger maps) remains very limited in most cases when controlling for trivial matches with the ID data. Surprisingly, we find that reasoning traces which combine multiple text formats yield the best (and non-trivial) OOD generalization. Finally, purely text-based models consistently outperform those utilizing image-based inputs, including a recently proposed approach relying on latent space reasoning.

Abstract: Optimization refers to the task of finding extrema of an objective function. Classical gradient-based optimizers are highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices. In highly non-convex settings their performance relies on carefully tuned learning rates, momentum, and gradient accumulation. To address these limitations, we introduce POP (Prior-fitted Optimizer Policies), a meta-learned optimizer that predicts coordinate-wise step sizes conditioned on the contextual information provided in the optimization trajectory. Our model is learned on millions of synthetic optimization problems sampled from a novel prior spanning both convex and non-convex objectives. We evaluate POP on an established benchmark including 47 optimization functions of various complexity, where it consistently outperforms first-order gradient-based methods, non-convex optimization approaches (e.g., evolutionary strategies), Bayesian optimization, and a recent meta-learned competitor under matched budget constraints. Our evaluation demonstrates strong generalization capabilities without task-specific tuning.

Abstract: Mood instability is a key behavioral indicator of mental health, yet traditional assessments rely on infrequent and retrospective reports that fail to capture its continuous nature. Smartphone-based mobile sensing enables passive, in-the-wild mood inference from everyday behaviors; however, deploying such systems at scale remains challenging due to privacy constraints, uneven sensing availability, and substantial variability in behavioral patterns.
  In this work, we study mood inference using smartphone sensing data in a cross-country federated learning setting, where each country participates as an independent client while retaining local data. We introduce FedFAP, a feature-aware personalized federated framework designed to accommodate heterogeneous sensing modalities across regions. Evaluations across geographically and culturally diverse populations show that FedFAP achieves an AUROC of 0.744, outperforming both centralized approaches and existing personalized federated baselines. Beyond inference, our results offer design insights for mood-aware systems, demonstrating how population-aware personalization and privacy-preserving learning can enable scalable and mood-aware mobile sensing technologies.

Abstract: LLM-as-a-judge has emerged as a cornerstone technique for evaluating large language models by leveraging LLM reasoning to score prompt-response pairs. Since LLM judgments are stochastic, practitioners commonly query each pair multiple times to estimate mean scores accurately. This raises a critical challenge: given a fixed computational budget $B$, how to optimally allocate queries across $K$ prompt-response pairs to minimize estimation error? %
We present a principled variance-adaptive approach leveraging multi-armed bandit theory and concentration inequalities. Our method dynamically allocates queries based on estimated score variances, concentrating resources where uncertainty is highest. Further, our algorithm is shown to achieve a worst-case score-estimation error of $\tilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^K σ_i^2}{B}}\right)$, $σ_i^2$ being the unknown score variance for pair $i \in [K]$ with near-optimal budget allocation. %
Experiments on \emph{Summarize-From-Feedback} and \emph{HelpSteer2} demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms uniform allocation, reducing worst-case estimation error while maintaining identical budgets. Our work establishes a theoretical foundation for efficient LLM evaluation with practical implications for AI safety, model alignment, and automated assessment at scale.

Abstract: It has been shown that a neural network's Lipschitz constant can be leveraged to derive robustness guarantees, to improve generalizability via regularization or even to construct invertible networks. Therefore, a number of methods varying in the tightness of their bounds and their computational cost have been developed to approximate the Lipschitz constant for different classes of networks. However, comparatively little research exists on methods for exact computation, which has been shown to be NP-hard. Nonetheless, there are applications where one might readily accept the computational cost of an exact method. These applications could include the benchmarking of new methods or the computation of robustness guarantees for small models on sensitive data. Unfortunately, existing exact algorithms restrict themselves to only ReLU-activated networks, which are known to come with severe downsides in the context of Lipschitz-constrained networks. We therefore propose a generalization of the LipBaB algorithm to compute exact Lipschitz constants for arbitrary piecewise linear neural networks and $p$-norms. With our method, networks may contain traditional activations like ReLU or LeakyReLU, activations like GroupSort or the related MinMax and FullSort, which have been of increasing interest in the context of Lipschitz constrained networks, or even other piecewise linear functions like MaxPool.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed training across multiple clients without centralized data sharing, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) model relational data through message passing. In federated GNN settings, client graphs often exhibit heterogeneous structural and propagation characteristics. When standard aggregation mechanisms are applied to such heterogeneous updates, the global model may converge numerically while exhibiting degraded relational behavior.Our work identifies a geometric failure mode of global aggregation in Cross- Domain Federated GNNs. Although GNN parameters are numerically represented as vectors, they encode relational transformations that govern the direction, strength, and sensitivity of information flow across graph neighborhoods. Aggregating updates originating from incompatible propagation regimes can therefore introduce destructive interference in this transformation space.This leads to loss of coherence in global message passing. Importantly, this degradation is not necessarily reflected in conventional metrics such as loss or accuracy.To address this issue, we propose GGRS (Global Geometric Reference Structure), a server-side framework that regulates client updates prior to aggregation based on geometric admissibility criteria. GGRS preserves directional consistency of relational transformations as well as maintains diversity of admissible propagation subspaces. It also stabilizes sensitivity to neighborhood interactions, without accessing client data or graph topology. Experiments on heterogeneous GNN-native, Amazon Co-purchase datasets demonstrate that GGRS preserves global message-passing coherence across training rounds by highlighting the necessity of geometry-aware regulation in federated graph learning.

Abstract: Training against white-box deception detectors has been proposed as a way to make AI systems honest. However, such training risks models learning to obfuscate their deception to evade the detector. Prior work has studied obfuscation only in artificial settings where models were directly rewarded for harmful output. We construct a realistic coding environment where reward hacking via hardcoding test cases naturally occurs, and show that obfuscation emerges in this setting. We introduce a taxonomy of possible outcomes when training against a deception detector. The model either remains honest, or becomes deceptive via two possible obfuscation strategies. (i) Obfuscated activations: the model outputs deceptive text while modifying its internal representations to no longer trigger the detector. (ii) Obfuscated policy: the model outputs deceptive text that evades the detector, typically by including a justification for the reward hack. Empirically, obfuscated activations arise from representation drift during RL, with or without a detector penalty. The probe penalty only incentivizes obfuscated policies; we theoretically show this is expected for policy gradient methods. Sufficiently high KL regularization and detector penalty can yield honest policies, establishing white-box deception detectors as viable training signals for tasks prone to reward hacking.

Abstract: The ability to accurately perform counterfactual inference on time series is crucial for decision-making in fields like finance, healthcare, and marketing, as it allows us to understand the impact of events or treatments on outcomes over time. In this paper, we introduce a new counterfactual inference approach tailored to time series data impacted by market events, which is motivated by an industrial application. Utilizing the abduction-action-prediction procedure and the Structural Causal Model framework, we first adapt methods based on variational autoencoders and adversarial autoencoders, both previously used in counterfactual literature although not in time series settings. Then, we present the Conditional Entropy-Penalized Autoencoder (CEPAE), a novel autoencoder-based approach for counterfactual inference, which employs an entropy penalization loss over the latent space to encourage disentangled data representations. We validate our approach both theoretically and experimentally on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets, showing that CEPAE generally outperforms the other approaches in the evaluated metrics.

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is an effective method to drastically reduce the memory footprint of LLMs while keeping performance degradation at an acceptable level. However, the optimal choice of quantization format and bit-width presents a challenge in practice. The full design space of quantization is not fully explored in the context of QAT, and the precise trade-off between quantization and downstream performance is poorly understood, as comparisons often rely solely on perplexity-based evaluations. In this work, we address these shortcomings with an empirical study of QAT in the low-bit regime. We show that k-means based weight quantization outperforms integer formats and can be implemented efficiently on standard hardware. Furthermore, we find that, under a fixed inference memory budget, the best performance on generative downstream tasks is achieved with $1$-bit quantized weights.

Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) is a biologically inspired algorithm for training neural networks that relies only on local updates, allowing parallel learning across layers. However, practical implementations face two key limitations: error signals must still propagate from the output to early layers through multiple inference-phase steps, and feedback decays exponentially during this process, leading to vanishing updates in early layers. We propose direct Kolen-Pollack predictive coding (DKP-PC), which simultaneously addresses both feedback delay and exponential decay, yielding a more efficient and scalable variant of PC while preserving update locality. Leveraging direct feedback alignment and direct Kolen-Pollack algorithms, DKP-PC introduces learnable feedback connections from the output layer to all hidden layers, establishing a direct pathway for error transmission. This yields an algorithm that reduces the theoretical error propagation time complexity from O(L), with L being the network depth, to O(1), removing depth-dependent delay in error signals. Moreover, empirical results demonstrate that DKP-PC achieves performance at least comparable to, and often exceeding, that of standard PC, while offering improved latency and computational performance, supporting its potential for custom hardware-efficient implementations.

Abstract: Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a widespread approach to simulate complex systems. Advancements in computational processing and storage have facilitated the adoption of ABMs across many fields; however, ABMs face challenges that limit their use as decision-support tools. A significant issue is parameter estimation in large-scale ABMs, particularly due to computational constraints on exploring the parameter space. This study evaluates a state-of-the-art simulation-based inference (SBI) framework that uses neural networks (NN) for parameter estimation. This framework is applied to an established labour market ABM based on job transition networks. The ABM is initiated with synthetic datasets and the real U.S. labour market. Next, we compare the effectiveness of summary statistics derived from a list of statistical measures with that learned by an embedded NN. The results demonstrate that the NN-based approach recovers the original parameters when evaluating posterior distributions across various dataset scales and improves efficiency compared to traditional Bayesian methods.

Abstract: Recurrent and deep neural networks (RNNs/DNNs) are cornerstone architectures in machine learning. Remarkably, RNNs differ from DNNs only by weight sharing, as can be shown through unrolling in time. How does this structural similarity fit with the distinct functional properties these networks exhibit? To address this question, we here develop a unified mean-field theory for RNNs and DNNs in terms of representational kernels, describing fully trained networks in the feature learning ($μ$P) regime. This theory casts training as Bayesian inference over sequences and patterns, directly revealing the functional implications induced by the RNNs' weight sharing. In DNN-typical tasks, we identify a phase transition when the learning signal overcomes the noise due to randomness in the weights: below this threshold, RNNs and DNNs behave identically; above it, only RNNs develop correlated representations across timesteps. For sequential tasks, the RNNs' weight sharing furthermore induces an inductive bias that aids generalization by interpolating unsupervised time steps. Overall, our theory offers a way to connect architectural structure to functional biases.

Abstract: Inverse design problems are common in engineering and materials science. The forward direction, i.e., computing output quantities from design parameters, typically requires running a numerical simulation, such as a FEM, as an intermediate step, which is an optimization problem by itself. In many scenarios, several design parameters can lead to the same or similar output values. For such cases, multi-modal probabilistic approaches are advantageous to obtain diverse solutions. A major difficulty in inverse design stems from the structure of the design space, since discrete parameters or further constraints disallow the direct use of gradient-based optimization. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel inverse design method based on diffusion models. Our approach relaxes the original design space into a continuous grid representation, where gradients can be computed by implicit differentiation in the forward simulation. A diffusion model is trained on this relaxed parameter space in order to serve as a prior for plausible relaxed designs. Parameters are sampled by guided diffusion using gradients that are propagated from an objective function specified at inference time through the differentiable simulation. A design sample is obtained by backprojection into the original parameter space. We develop our approach for a composite material design problem where the forward process is modeled as a linear FEM problem. We evaluate the performance of our approach in finding designs that match a specified bulk modulus. We demonstrate that our method can propose diverse designs within 1% relative error margin from medium to high target bulk moduli in 2D and 3D settings. We also demonstrate that the material density of generated samples can be minimized simultaneously by using a multi-objective loss function.

Abstract: Ensuring user fairness in wireless communications is a fundamental challenge, as balancing the trade-off between fairness and sum rate leads to a non-convex, multi-objective optimization whose complexity grows with network scale. To alleviate this conflict, we propose an optimization-based unsupervised learning approach based on the wireless transformer (WiT) architecture that learns from channel state information (CSI) features. We reformulate the trade-off by combining the sum rate and fairness objectives through a Lagrangian multiplier, which is updated automatically via a dual-ascent algorithm. This mechanism allows for a controllable fairness constraint while simultaneously maximizing the sum rate, effectively realizing a trace on the Pareto front between two conflicting objectives. Our findings show that the proposed approach offers a flexible solution for managing the trade-off optimization under prescribed fairness.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) learn node representations through iterative network-based message-passing. While powerful, deep GNNs suffer from oversmoothing, where node features converge to a homogeneous, non-informative state. We re-frame this problem of representational collapse from a \emph{bifurcation theory} perspective, characterizing oversmoothing as convergence to a stable ``homogeneous fixed point.'' Our central contribution is the theoretical discovery that this undesired stability can be broken by replacing standard monotone activations (e.g., ReLU) with a class of functions. Using Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction, we analytically prove that this substitution induces a bifurcation that destabilizes the homogeneous state and creates a new pair of stable, non-homogeneous \emph{patterns} that provably resist oversmoothing. Our theory predicts a precise, nontrivial scaling law for the amplitude of these emergent patterns, which we quantitatively validate in experiments. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our theory by deriving a closed-form, bifurcation-aware initialization and showing its utility in real benchmark experiments.

Abstract: Time-series imputation benchmarks employ uniform random masking and shape-agnostic metrics (MSE, RMSE), implicitly weighting evaluation by regime prevalence. In systems with a dominant attractor -- homeostatic physiology, nominal industrial operation, stable network traffic -- this creates a systematic \emph{Stationarity Bias}: simple methods appear superior because the benchmark predominantly samples the easy, low-entropy regime where they trivially succeed. We formalize this bias and propose a \emph{Stratified Stress-Test} that partitions evaluation into Stationary and Transient regimes. Using Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) as a testbed -- chosen for its rigorous ground-truth forcing functions (meals, insulin) that enable precise regime identification -- we establish three findings with broad implications:(i)~Stationary Efficiency: Linear interpolation achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction during stable intervals, confirming that complex architectures are computationally wasteful in low-entropy regimes.(ii)~Transient Fidelity: During critical transients (post-prandial peaks, hypoglycemic events), linear methods exhibit drastically degraded morphological fidelity (DTW), disproportionate to their RMSE -- a phenomenon we term the \emph{RMSE Mirage}, where low pointwise error masks the destruction of signal shape.(iii)~Regime-Conditional Model Selection: Deep learning models preserve both pointwise accuracy and morphological integrity during transients, making them essential for safety-critical downstream tasks. We further derive empirical missingness distributions from clinical trials and impose them on complete training data, preventing models from exploiting unrealistically clean observations and encouraging robustness under real-world missingness. This framework generalizes to any regulated system where routine stationarity dominates critical transients.

Abstract: In dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) we aim to recover the dynamical system (DS) underlying observed time series. Specifically, we aim to learn a generative surrogate model which approximates the underlying, data-generating DS, and recreates its long-term properties (`climate statistics'). In scientific and medical areas, in particular, these models need to be mechanistically tractable -- through their mathematical analysis we would like to obtain insight into the recovered system's workings. Piecewise-linear (PL), ReLU-based RNNs (PLRNNs) have a strong track-record in this regard, representing SOTA DSR models while allowing mathematical insight by virtue of their PL design. However, all current PLRNN variants are discrete-time maps. This is in disaccord with the assumed continuous-time nature of most physical and biological processes, and makes it hard to accommodate data arriving at irregular temporal intervals. Neural ODEs are one solution, but they do not reach the DSR performance of PLRNNs and often lack their tractability. Here we develop theory for continuous-time PLRNNs (cPLRNNs): We present a novel algorithm for training and simulating such models, bypassing numerical integration by efficiently exploiting their PL structure. We further demonstrate how important topological objects like equilibria or limit cycles can be determined semi-analytically in trained models. We compare cPLRNNs to both their discrete-time cousins as well as Neural ODEs on DSR benchmarks, including systems with discontinuities which come with hard thresholds.

Abstract: Neural networks can accurately forecast complex dynamical systems, yet how they internally represent underlying latent geometry remains poorly understood. We study neural forecasters through the lens of representational alignment, introducing anchor-based, geometry-agnostic relative embeddings that remove rotational and scaling ambiguities in latent spaces. Applying this framework across seven canonical dynamical systems - ranging from periodic to chaotic - we reveal reproducible family-level structure: multilayer perceptrons align with other MLPs, recurrent networks with RNNs, while transformers and echo-state networks achieve strong forecasts despite weaker alignment. Alignment generally correlates with forecasting accuracy, yet high accuracy can coexist with low alignment. Relative geometry thus provides a simple, reproducible foundation for comparing how model families internalize and represent dynamical structure.

Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECG) are electrical recordings of the heart that are critical for diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. ECG language models (ELMs) have recently emerged as a promising framework for ECG classification accompanied by report generation. However, current models cannot forecast future cardiac events despite the immense clinical value for planning earlier intervention. To address this gap, we propose CAMEL, the first ELM that is capable of inference over longer signal durations which enables its forecasting capability. Our key insight is a specialized ECG encoder which enables cross-understanding of ECG signals with text. We train CAMEL using established LLM training procedures, combining LoRA adaptation with a curriculum learning pipeline. Our curriculum includes ECG classification, metrics calculations, and multi-turn conversations to elicit reasoning. CAMEL demonstrates strong zero-shot performance across 6 tasks and 9 datasets, including ECGForecastBench, a new benchmark that we introduce for forecasting arrhythmias. CAMEL is on par with or surpasses ELMs and fully supervised baselines both in- and out-of-distribution, achieving SOTA results on ECGBench (+7.0% absolute average gain) as well as ECGForecastBench (+12.4% over fully supervised models and +21.1% over zero-shot ELMs).

Abstract: Learning dynamical systems through purely data-driven methods is challenging as they do not learn the underlying conservation laws that enable them to correctly generalize. Existing port-Hamiltonian neural network methods have recently been successfully applied for modeling mechanical systems. However, even though these methods are designed on power-balance principles, they usually do not consider power-preserving discretizations and often rely on Runge-Kutta numerical methods. In this work, we propose to use a second-order discrete gradient method embedded in the learning of dynamical systems with port-Hamiltonian neural networks. Numerical results are provided for three systems deliberately selected to span different ranges of dynamical behavior under control: a baseline harmonic oscillator with quadratic energy storage; a Duffing oscillator, with a non-quadratic Hamiltonian offering amplitude-dependent effects; and a self-sustained oscillator, which can stabilize in a controlled limit cycle through the incorporation of a nonlinear dissipation. We show how the use of this discrete gradient method outperforms the performance of a Runge-Kutta method of the same order. Experiments are also carried out to compare two theoretically equivalent port-Hamiltonian systems formulations and to analyze the impact of regularizing the Jacobian of port-Hamiltonian neural networks during training.

Abstract: Node embeddings map graph vertices into low-dimensional Euclidean spaces while preserving structural information. They are central to tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and signal reconstruction. A key goal is to design node embeddings whose dot products capture meaningful notions of node similarity induced by the graph. Graph kernels offer a principled way to define such similarities, but their direct computation is often prohibitive for large networks. Inspired by random feature methods for kernel approximation in Euclidean spaces, we introduce randomized spectral node embeddings whose dot products estimate a low-rank approximation of any specific graph kernel. We provide theoretical and empirical results showing that our embeddings achieve more accurate kernel approximations than existing methods, particularly for spectrally localized kernels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of randomized spectral constructions for scalable and principled graph representation learning.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition necessitating early and precise diagnosis to provide prompt clinical management. Given the paramount importance of early diagnosis, recent studies have increasingly focused on computer-aided diagnostic models to enhance precision and reliability. However, most graph-based approaches still rely on fixed structural designs, which restrict their flexibility and limit generalization across heterogeneous patient data. To overcome these limitations, the Meta-Relational Copula-Based Graph Attention Network (MRC-GAT) is proposed as an efficient multimodal model for AD classification tasks. The proposed architecture, copula-based similarity alignment, relational attention, and node fusion are integrated as the core components of episodic meta-learning, such that the multimodal features, including risk factors (RF), Cognitive test scores, and MRI attributes, are first aligned via a copula-based transformation in a common statistical space and then combined by a multi-relational attention mechanism. According to evaluations performed on the TADPOLE and NACC datasets, the MRC-GAT model achieved accuracies of 96.87% and 92.31%, respectively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance compared to existing diagnostic models. Finally, the proposed model confirms the robustness and applicability of the proposed method by providing interpretability at various stages of disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Recent advances in urban region representation learning have enabled a wide range of applications in urban analytics, yet existing methods remain limited in their capabilities to generalize across cities and analytic tasks. We aim to generalize urban representation learning beyond city- and task-specific settings, towards a foundation-style model for urban analytics. To this end, we propose UrbanVerse, a model for cross-city urban representation learning and cross-task urban analytics. For cross-city generalization, UrbanVerse focuses on features local to the target regions and structural features of the nearby regions rather than the entire city. We model regions as nodes on a graph, which enables a random walk-based procedure to form "sequences of regions" that reflect both local and neighborhood structural features for urban region representation learning. For cross-task generalization, we propose a cross-task learning module named HCondDiffCT. This module integrates region-conditioned prior knowledge and task-conditioned semantics into the diffusion process to jointly model multiple downstream urban prediction tasks. HCondDiffCT is generic. It can also be integrated with existing urban representation learning models to enhance their downstream task effectiveness. Experiments on real-world datasets show that UrbanVerse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across six tasks under cross-city settings, achieving up to 35.89% improvements in prediction accuracy.

Abstract: On two-sided matching platforms such as online dating and recruiting, recommendation algorithms often aim to maximize the total number of matches. However, this objective creates an imbalance, where some users receive far too many matches while many others receive very few and eventually abandon the platform. Retaining users is crucial for many platforms, such as those that depend heavily on subscriptions. Some may use fairness objectives to solve the problem of match maximization. However, fairness in itself is not the ultimate objective for many platforms, as users do not suddenly reward the platform simply because exposure is equalized. In practice, where user retention is often the ultimate goal, casually relying on fairness will leave the optimization of retention up to luck.
  In this work, instead of maximizing matches or axiomatically defining fairness, we formally define the new problem setting of maximizing user retention in two-sided matching platforms. To this end, we introduce a dynamic learning-to-rank (LTR) algorithm called Matching for Retention (MRet). Unlike conventional algorithms for two-sided matching, our approach models user retention by learning personalized retention curves from each user's profile and interaction history. Based on these curves, MRet dynamically adapts recommendations by jointly considering the retention gains of both the user receiving recommendations and those who are being recommended, so that limited matching opportunities can be allocated where they most improve overall retention. Naturally but importantly, empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets from a major online dating platform show that MRet achieves higher user retention, since conventional methods optimize matches or fairness rather than retention.

Abstract: We present GLM-5, a next-generation foundation model designed to transition the paradigm of vibe coding to agentic engineering. Building upon the agentic, reasoning, and coding (ARC) capabilities of its predecessor, GLM-5 adopts DSA to significantly reduce training and inference costs while maintaining long-context fidelity. To advance model alignment and autonomy, we implement a new asynchronous reinforcement learning infrastructure that drastically improves post-training efficiency by decoupling generation from training. Furthermore, we propose novel asynchronous agent RL algorithms that further improve RL quality, enabling the model to learn from complex, long-horizon interactions more effectively. Through these innovations, GLM-5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on major open benchmarks. Most critically, GLM-5 demonstrates unprecedented capability in real-world coding tasks, surpassing previous baselines in handling end-to-end software engineering challenges.

Abstract: Fine-tuning aligned language models on benign tasks unpredictably degrades safety guardrails, even when training data contains no harmful content and developers have no adversarial intent. We show that the prevailing explanation, that fine-tuning updates should be orthogonal to safety-critical directions in high-dimensional parameter space, offers false reassurance: we show this orthogonality is structurally unstable and collapses under the dynamics of gradient descent. We then resolve this through a novel geometric analysis, proving that alignment concentrates in low-dimensional subspaces with sharp curvature, creating a brittle structure that first-order methods cannot detect or defend. While initial fine-tuning updates may indeed avoid these subspaces, the curvature of the fine-tuning loss generates second-order acceleration that systematically steers trajectories into alignment-sensitive regions. We formalize this mechanism through the Alignment Instability Condition, three geometric properties that, when jointly satisfied, lead to safety degradation. Our main result establishes a quartic scaling law: alignment loss grows with the fourth power of training time, governed by the sharpness of alignment geometry and the strength of curvature coupling between the fine-tuning task and safety-critical parameters. These results expose a structural blind spot in the current safety paradigm. The dominant approaches to safe fine-tuning address only the initial snapshot of a fundamentally dynamic problem. Alignment fragility is not a bug to be patched; it is an intrinsic geometric property of gradient descent on curved manifolds. Our results motivate the development of curvature-aware methods, and we hope will further enable a shift in alignment safety analysis from reactive red-teaming to predictive diagnostics for open-weight model deployment.

Abstract: Machine learning surrogates are increasingly used in engineering to accelerate costly simulations, yet distribution shifts between training and deployment often cause severe performance degradation (e.g., unseen geometries or configurations). Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) can mitigate such shifts, but existing methods are largely developed for lower-dimensional classification with structured outputs and visually aligned input-output relationships, making them unstable for the high-dimensional, unstructured and regression problems common in simulation. We address this challenge by proposing a TTA framework based on storing maximally informative (D-optimal) statistics, which jointly enables stable adaptation and principled parameter selection at test time. When applied to pretrained simulation surrogates, our method yields up to 7% out-of-distribution improvements at negligible computational cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic demonstration of effective TTA for high-dimensional simulation regression and generative design optimization, validated on the SIMSHIFT and EngiBench benchmarks.

Abstract: A central challenge in large language model (LLM) editing is capability preservation: methods that successfully change targeted behavior can quietly game the editing proxy and corrupt general capabilities, producing degenerate behaviors reminiscent of proxy/reward hacking. We present CrispEdit, a scalable and principled second-order editing algorithm that treats capability preservation as an explicit constraint, unifying and generalizing several existing editing approaches. CrispEdit formulates editing as constrained optimization and enforces the constraint by projecting edit updates onto the low-curvature subspace of the capability-loss landscape. At the crux of CrispEdit is expressing capability constraint via Bregman divergence, whose quadratic form yields the Gauss-Newton Hessian exactly and even when the base model is not trained to convergence. We make this second-order procedure efficient at the LLM scale using Kronecker-factored approximate curvature (K-FAC) and a novel matrix-free projector that exploits Kronecker structure to avoid constructing massive projection matrices. Across standard model-editing benchmarks, CrispEdit achieves high edit success while keeping capability degradation below 1% on average across datasets, significantly improving over prior editors.

Abstract: The superficial alignment hypothesis (SAH) posits that large language models learn most of their knowledge during pre-training, and that post-training merely surfaces this knowledge. The SAH, however, lacks a precise definition, which has led to (i) different and seemingly orthogonal arguments supporting it, and (ii) important critiques to it. We propose a new metric called task complexity: the length of the shortest program that achieves a target performance on a task. In this framework, the SAH simply claims that pre-trained models drastically reduce the complexity of achieving high performance on many tasks. Our definition unifies prior arguments supporting the SAH, interpreting them as different strategies to find such short programs. Experimentally, we estimate the task complexity of mathematical reasoning, machine translation, and instruction following; we then show that these complexities can be remarkably low when conditioned on a pre-trained model. Further, we find that pre-training enables access to strong performances on our tasks, but it can require programs of gigabytes of length to access them. Post-training, on the other hand, collapses the complexity of reaching this same performance by several orders of magnitude. Overall, our results highlight that task adaptation often requires surprisingly little information -- often just a few kilobytes.

Abstract: Based on the Breslauer-Italiano online suffix tree construction algorithm (2013) with double logarithmic worst-case guarantees on the update time per letter, we develop near-real-time algorithms for several classical problems on strings, including the computation of the longest repeating suffix array, the (reversed) Lempel-Ziv 77 factorization, and the maintenance of minimal unique substrings, all in an online manner. Our solutions improve over the best known running times for these problems in terms of the worst-case time per letter, for which we achieve a poly-log-logarithmic time complexity, within a linear space. Best known results for these problems require a poly-logarithmic time complexity per letter or only provide amortized complexity bounds. As a result of independent interest, we give conversions between the longest previous factor array and the longest repeating suffix array in space and time bounds based on their irreducible representations, which can have sizes sublinear in the length of the input string.

Abstract: The sparse matrix compression problem asks for a one-dimensional representation of a binary $n \times \ell$ matrix, formed by an integer array of row indices and a shift function for each row, such that accessing a matrix entry is possible in constant time by consulting this representation. It has been shown that the decision problem for finding an integer array of length $\ell+ρ$ or restricting the shift function up to values of $ρ$ is NP-complete (cf. the textbook of Garey and Johnson). As a practical heuristic, a greedy algorithm has been proposed to shift the $i$-th row until it forms a solution with its predecessor rows. Despite that this greedy algorithm is cherished for its good approximation in practice, we show that it actually exhibits an approximation ratio of $Θ(\sqrt{\ell+ρ})$. We give further hardness results for parameterizations such as the number of distinct rows or the maximum number of non-zero entries per row. Finally, we devise a DP-algorithm that solves the problem for double-logarithmic matrix widths or logarithmic widths for further restrictions. We study all these findings also under a new perspective by introducing a variant of the problem, where we wish to minimize the length of the resulting integer array by trimming the non-zero borders, which has not been studied in the literature before but has practical motivations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study monotonicity testing of real-valued functions on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with $n$ vertices. For every constant $δ>0$, we prove a $Ω(n^{1/2-δ}/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ lower bound against non-adaptive two-sided testers on DAGs, nearly matching the classical $O(\sqrt{n/\varepsilon})$-query upper bound. For constant $\varepsilon$, we also prove an $Ω(\sqrt n)$ lower bound for randomized adaptive one-sided testers on explicit bipartite DAGs, whereas previously only an $Ω(\log n)$ lower bound was known. A key technical ingredient in both lower bounds is positive-matching Ruzsa--Szemerédi families. On the algorithmic side, we give simple non-adaptive one-sided testers with query complexity $O(\sqrt{m\,\ell}/(\varepsilon n))$ and $O(m^{1/3}/\varepsilon^{2/3})$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the transitive reduction and $\ell$ is the number of edges in the transitive closure. For constant $\varepsilon>0$, these improve over the previous $O(\sqrt{n/\varepsilon})$ bound when $m\ell=o(n^3)$ and $m=o(n^{3/2})$, respectively.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Memory Reallocation problem asks to dynamically maintain an assignment of given objects of various sizes to non-overlapping contiguous chunks of memory, while supporting updates (insertions/deletions) in an online fashion. The total size of live objects at any time is guaranteed to be at most a $1-ε$ fraction of the total memory. To handle an online update, the allocator may rearrange the objects in memory to make space, and the overhead for this update is defined as the total size of moved objects divided by the size of the object being inserted/deleted.
  Our main result is an allocator with worst-case expected overhead $\mathrm{polylog}(ε^{-1})$. This exponentially improves the previous worst-case expected overhead $\tilde O(ε^{-1/2})$ achieved by Farach-Colton, Kuszmaul, Sheffield, and Westover (2024), narrowing the gap towards the $Ω(\logε^{-1})$ lower bound. Our improvement is based on an application of the sunflower lemma previously used by Erdős and Sárközy (1992) in the context of subset sums.
  Our allocator achieves polylogarithmic overhead only in expectation, and sometimes performs expensive rebuilds. Our second technical result shows that this is necessary: it is impossible to achieve subpolynomial overhead with high probability.

Abstract: We study the generalization of Correlation Clustering which incorporates fairness constraints via the notion of fairlets. The corresponding Fair Correlation Clustering problem has been studied from several perspectives to date, but has so far lacked a detailed analysis from the parameterized complexity paradigm. We close this gap by providing tractability results for the problem under a variety of structural graph parameterizations, including treewidth, treedepth and the vertex cover number; our results lie at the very edge of tractability given the known NP-hardness of the problem on severely restricted inputs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Given two matroids $\mathcal{M}_1$ and $\mathcal{M}_2$ over the same ground set, the matroid intersection problem is to find the maximum cardinality common independent set. In the weighted version of the problem, the goal is to find a maximum weight common independent set. It has been a matter of interest to find efficient approximation algorithms for this problem in various settings. In many of these models, there is a gap between the best known results for the unweighted and weighted versions. In this work, we address the question of closing this gap. Our main result is a reduction which converts any $α$-approximate unweighted matroid intersection algorithm into an $α(1-\varepsilon)$-approximate weighted matroid intersection algorithm, while increasing the runtime of the algorithm by a $\log W$ factor, where $W$ is the aspect ratio. Our framework is versatile and translates to settings such as streaming and one-way communication complexity where matroid intersection is well-studied. As a by-product of our techniques, we derive new results for weighted matroid intersection in these models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We initiate an investigation of node differential privacy for graphs in the local model of private data analysis. In our model, dubbed LNDP, each node sees its own edge list and releases the output of a local randomizer on this input. These outputs are aggregated by an untrusted server to obtain a final output.
  We develop a novel algorithmic framework for this setting that allows us to accurately answer arbitrary linear queries on a blurry approximation of the input graph's degree distribution. For some natural problems, the resulting algorithms match the accuracy achievable with node privacy in the central model, where data are held and processed by a trusted server. We also prove lower bounds on the error required by LNDP that imply the optimality of our algorithms for several fundamental graph statistics. We then lift these lower bounds to the interactive LNDP setting, demonstrating the optimality of our algorithms even when constantly many rounds of interaction are permitted. Obtaining our lower bounds requires new approaches, since those developed for the usual local model do not apply to the inherently overlapping inputs that arise from graphs. Finally, we prove structural results that reveal qualitative differences between local node privacy and the standard local model for tabular data.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures decompose prediction tasks into specialized expert sub-networks selected by a gating mechanism. This letter adopts a communication-theoretic view of MoE gating, modeling the gate as a stochastic channel operating under a finite information rate. Within an information-theoretic learning framework, we specialize a mutual-information generalization bound and develop a rate-distortion characterization $D(R_g)$ of finite-rate gating, where $R_g:=I(X; T)$, yielding (under a standard empirical rate-distortion optimality condition) $\mathbb{E}[R(W)] \le D(R_g)+δ_m+\sqrt{(2/m)\, I(S; W)}$. The analysis yields capacity-aware limits for communication-constrained MoE systems, and numerical simulations on synthetic multi-expert models empirically confirm the predicted trade-offs between gating rate, expressivity, and generalization.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We theoretically justify the recent empirical finding of [Teh et al., 2025] that a transformer pretrained on synthetically generated data achieves strong performance on empirical Bayes (EB) problems. We take an indirect approach to this question: rather than analyzing the model architecture or training dynamics, we ask why a pretrained Bayes estimator, trained under a prespecified training distribution, can adapt to arbitrary test distributions. Focusing on Poisson EB problems, we identify the existence of universal priors such that training under these priors yields a near-optimal regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\frac{1}{n})$ uniformly over all test distributions. Our analysis leverages the classical phenomenon of posterior contraction in Bayesian statistics, showing that the pretrained transformer adapts to unknown test distributions precisely through posterior contraction. This perspective also explains the phenomenon of length generalization, in which the test sequence length exceeds the training length, as the model performs Bayesian inference using a generalized posterior.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Causal structure learning, also known as causal discovery, aims to estimate causal relationships between variables as a form of a causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) from observational data. One of the major frameworks is the order-based approach that first estimates a topological order of the underlying DAG and then prunes spurious edges from the fully-connected DAG induced by the estimated topological order. Previous studies often focus on the former ordering step because it can dramatically reduce the search space of DAGs. In practice, the latter pruning step is equally crucial for ensuring both computational efficiency and estimation accuracy. Most existing methods employ a pruning technique based on generalized additive models and hypothesis testing, commonly known as CAM-pruning. However, this approach can be a computational bottleneck as it requires repeatedly fitting additive models for all variables. Furthermore, it may harm estimation quality due to multiple testing. To address these issues, we introduce a new pruning method based on sparse additive models, which enables direct pruning of redundant edges without relying on hypothesis testing. We propose an efficient algorithm for learning sparse additive models by combining the randomized tree embedding technique with group-wise sparse regression. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrated that our method is significantly faster than existing pruning methods while maintaining comparable or superior accuracy.

Abstract: We study the asymptotic shape of the trajectory of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm applied to a convex objective function. Under mild regularity assumptions, we prove a functional central limit theorem for the properly rescaled trajectory. Our result characterizes the long-term fluctuations of the algorithm around the minimizer by providing a diffusion limit for the trajectory. In contrast with classical central limit theorems for the last iterate or Polyak-Ruppert averages, this functional result captures the temporal structure of the fluctuations and applies to non-smooth settings such as robust location estimation, including the geometric median.
